abstract = {Over 400 million hectares of tropical forest are currently designated as logging concessions. This practice is an important source of timber, but there are concerns about its long-term sustainability and impacts on biodiversity and carbon storage. However, logging impacts vary widely, making generalisation and, consequently, policy implementation, difficult. Recent syntheses of animal biodiversity have indicated that differences in logging intensity - the volume of wood removed ha-1 - might help to explain some of these disparities. In addition, it has widely been assumed that reduced impact logging (RIL) might minimise some of the negative effects of logging; though in practice, this has rarely been tested. To test the hypothesis that RIL reduces negative impacts of selective logging once intensity is controlled for, we used meta-analyses of selective logging impact studies, focusing specifically on (1) residual tree damage, (2) aboveground biomass and (3) tree species richness. Our results indicate that RIL appears to reduce residual tree damage when compared to conventional methods. However, changes in aboveground biomass were negatively related to logging intensity. Any effect of RIL, independent of logging intensity, was difficult to discern since it was carried out at relatively low intensities. Tree richness appeared to increase at low intensities but decreased at higher intensities and any effect of RIL was difficult to detect. Our results tentatively support the hypothesis that RIL reduces the negative impacts of logging on tree damage, but do not support suggestions that RIL reduces loss of aboveground biomass or tree species richness. However, this lack of support may be a result of the relative paucity of data on the topic. Based on our results, we suggest that better evidence is needed to assess the differences between the impacts of RIL and conventional logging. Studies that consider plot-level differences in logging intensity are required to fill this knowledge gap. In addition, there must be clarification of whether RIL is an inherently low intensity practice so that this can be factored into management.},

abstract = {* 1Tropical rain forest tree species are commonly perceived to have more generalized habitat distributions than understorey species. However, the correspondence between floristic patterns in large trees and smaller understorey plants in relation to environmental differences has rarely been investigated. Comparative analyses are complicated by the fact that tree data are often much more noisy, with higher overall species richness and poorer spatial and temporal representation of species composition within sampling plots.
* 2Using data on trees and pteridophytes collected in 1125 plots located within 6 km2 of lowland rain forest in Costa Rica, we asked: (i) Is there evidence that trees are more generalized in their edaphic and topographic distributions than pteridophytes, and (ii) How much might differences in sampling efficiency affect the results?
* 3We ran community-level analyses using Mantel tests, and for the five most frequent tree and pteridophyte species we ran logistic regression analyses of species occurrence. To investigate the influence of differing sampling efficiency, the analyses were repeated with four rarefied pteridophyte data sets approximating key structural features of the tree data set.
* 4Differences in community composition in trees and in all pteridophyte data sets were most strongly correlated with environmental differences in the same five soil variables. The most frequent species in both plant groups had non-random edaphic and topographic distributions.
* 5Both Mantel correlations and the predictive performance of single species models (AUC values) were higher for the full pteridophyte data set than for trees, but these differences were much reduced after pteridophyte rarefaction.
* 6The performance of the species occurrence models calibrated with rarefied pteridophyte data appeared poor when tested on rarefied data. However, their performance in predicting occurrences in the full data set was usually moderate (AUC {\{}{\textgreater}{\}} 0.70). This suggests that the tree species models may also predict species' potential habitat distributions better than is apparent from their AUC values.
* 7Synthesis. Our results indicate that rain forest trees and pteridophytes may respond to mesoscale environmental variation in qualitatively similar ways, but that trees will appear much more generalized in their response to the environment unless differences in sampling efficiency are taken into account.},

@article{merow_practical_2013,
abstract = {The MaxEnt software package is one of the most popular tools for species distribution and environmental niche modeling, with over 1000 published applications since 2006. Its popularity is likely for two reasons: 1) MaxEnt typically outperforms other methods based on predictive accuracy and 2) the software is particularly easy to use. MaxEnt users must make a number of decisions about how they should select their input data and choose from a wide variety of settings in the software package to build models from these data. The underlying basis for making these decisions is unclear in many studies, and default settings are apparently chosen, even though alternative settings are often more appropriate. In this paper, we provide a detailed explanation of how MaxEnt works and a prospectus on modeling options to enable users to make informed decisions when preparing data, choosing settings and interpreting output. We explain how the choice of background samples reflects prior assumptions, how nonlinear functions of environmental variables (features) are created and selected, how to account for environmentally biased sampling, the interpretation of the various types of model output and the challenges for model evaluation. We demonstrate MaxEnt's calculations using both simplified simulated data and occurrence data from South Africa on species of the flowering plant family Proteaceae. Throughout, we show how MaxEnt's outputs vary in response to different settings to highlight the need for making biologically motivated modeling decisions.},

abstract = {An important decision in presence-only species distribution modeling is how to select background (or pseudo-absence) localities for model parameterization. The selection of such localities may influence model parameterization and thus, can influence the appropriateness and accuracy of the model prediction when extrapolating the species distribution across time and space. We used 12 species from the Australian Wet Tropics (AWT) to evaluate the relationship between the geographic extent from which pseudo-absences are taken and model performance, and shape and importance of predictor variables using the MAXENT modeling method. Model performance is lower when pseudo-absence points are taken from either a restricted or broad region with respect to species occurrence data than from an intermediate region. Furthermore, variable importance (i.e., contribution to the model) changed such that, models became increasingly simplified, dominated by just two variables, as the area from which pseudo-absence points were drawn increased. Our results suggest that it is important to consider the spatial extent from which pseudo-absence data are taken. We suggest species distribution modeling exercises should begin with exploratory analyses evaluating what extent might provide both the most accurate results and biologically meaningful fit between species occurrence and predictor variables. This is especially important when modeling across space or time—a growing application for species distributional modeling.},

abstract = {Aim Climatic niche modelling of species and community distributions implicitly assumes strong and constant climatic determinism across geographical space. We tested this assumption by assessing how stacked-species distribution models (S-SDMs) perform for predicting plant species assemblages along elevation gradients. Location The western Swiss Alps. Methods Using robust presence–absence data, we first assessed the ability of topo-climatic S-SDMs to predict plant assemblages in a study area encompassing a 2800-m wide elevation gradient. We then assessed the relationships among several evaluation metrics and trait-based tests of community assembly rules. Results The standard errors of individual SDMs decreased significantly towards higher elevations. Overall, the S-SDM overpredicted far more than they underpredicted richness and could not reproduce the humpback curve along elevation. Overprediction was greater at low and mid-range elevations in absolute values but greater at high elevations when standardized by the actual richness. Looking at species composition, overall prediction success, kappa and specificity increased with increasing elevation, while the Jaccard index and sensitivity decreased. The best overall evaluation – as driven by specificity – occurred at high elevation where species assemblages were shown to be subject to significant environmental filtering of small plants. In contrast, the decreased overall accuracy in the lowlands was associated with functional patterns representing any type of assembly rule (environmental filtering, limiting similarity or null assembly). Main conclusions We provide a thorough evaluation of S-SDM emphasizing the need to carefully interpret standard evaluation metrics, which reflect different aspects of assemblage predictions. We further reported interesting patterns of change in S-SDM errors with changes in assembly rules along elevation. Yet, significant levels of assemblage prediction errors occurred throughout the gradient, calling for further improvement of SDMs, e.g. by adding key environmental filters that act at fine scales and developing approaches to account for variations in the influence of predictors along environmental gradients},

abstract = {1. Current thinking holds that wood density mediates a tradeoff between strength and economy of construction, with higher wood density providing higher strength but at higher cost. 2. Yet the further away wood fibres are from the central axis of the trunk, the more they increase the strength of the trunk; thus, a fat trunk of low-density wood can achieve greater strength at lower construction cost than a thin trunk of high-density wood. 3. What then are the countervailing advantages of high wood density? 4. We hypothesize that high wood density is associated with lower maintenance costs due to lower trunk surface area, as surface area correlates with maintenance respiration. 5. This advantage would be particularly important to long-lived trees and could in part explain why they tend to have high wood density. 6. High wood density has also been associated with lower risk of trunk breakage, xylem implosion and pathogen invasion, but we argue that these relationships are not causal and instead reflect correlated selection on other traits of value to long-lived trees. 7. This revaluation of the costs and benefits of high wood density has important implications for understanding tree life-history evolution, functional diversity, forest carbon stocks and the impacts of global change.},

@article{fortunel_leaf_2012,
abstract = {1. Trade-offs among functional traits reveal major plant strategies that can give insight into species distributions and ecosystem processes. However, current identification of plant strategies lacks the integration of root structural traits together with leaf and stem traits. 2. We examined correlations among 14 traits representing leaf, stem and woody root tissues. Traits were measured on 1084 individuals representing 758 Neotropical tree species, across 13 sites representative of the environmental variation encompassed by three widespread habitats (seasonally flooded, clay terra firme and white-sand forests) at opposite ends of Amazonia (French Guiana and Peru). 3. Woody root traits were closely aligned with stem traits, but not with leaf traits. Altogether leaf, stem and woody root traits delineated two orthogonal axes of functional trade-offs: a first axis defined by leaf traits, corresponding to a ‘leaf economics spectrum', and a second axis defined by covarying stem and woody root traits, corresponding to a ‘wood economics spectrum'. These axes remained consistent when accounting for species evolutionary history with phylogenetically independent contrasts. 4. Despite the strong species turnover across sites, the covariation among root and stem structural traits as well as their orthogonality to leaf traits were strongly consistent across habitats and regions. 5. We conclude that root structural traits mirrored stem traits rather than leaf traits in Neotropical trees. Leaf and wood traits define an integrated whole-plant strategy in lowland South American forests that may contribute to a more complete understanding of plant responses to global changes in both correlative and modelling approaches. We suggest further meta-analyses in expanded environmental and geographic zones to determine the generality of this pattern.},

@article{Bugmann2001,
abstract = {Forest gap models, initially conceived in 1969 as a special case of individual-tree based models, have become widely popular among forest ecologists for addressing a large number of applied research questions, including the impacts of global change on long-term dynamics of forest structure, biomass, and composition. However, they have been strongly criticized for a number of weaknesses inherent in the original model structure. In this paper, I review the fundamental assumptions underlying forest gap models, the structure of the parent model JABOWA, and examine these criticisms in the context of the many alternative formulations that have been developed over the past 30 years. Four assumptions originally underlie gap models: (1) The forest is abstracted as a composite of many small patches of land, where each can have a different age and successional stage; (2) patches are horizontally homogeneous, i.e., tree position within a patch is not considered; (3) the leaves of each tree are located in an indefinitely thin layer (disk) at the top of the stem; and (4) successional processes are described on each patch separately, i.e., there are no interactions between patches. These simplifications made it possible to consider mixed-species, mixed-age forests, which had been difficult previously mainly because of computing limitations. The structure of JABOWA is analysed in terms of the functional relationships used for formulating the processes of tree establishment, growth, and mortality. It is concluded that JABOWA contains a number of unrealistic assumptions that have not been questioned strongly to date. At the same time, some aspects of JABOWA that were criticized strongly in the past years are internally consistent given the objectives of this specific model. A wide variety of formulations for growth processes, establishment, and mortality factors have been developed in gap models over the past 30 years, and modern gap models include more robust parameterizations of environmental influences on tree growth and population dynamics as compared to JABOWA. Approaches taken in more recent models that led to the relaxation of one or several of the four basic assumptions are discussed. It is found that the original assumptions often have been replaced by alternatives; however, no systematic analysis of the behavioral effects of these conceptual changes has been attempted to date. The feasibility of including more physiological detail (instead of using relatively simple parameterizations) in forest gap models is discussed, and it is concluded that we often lack the data base to implement such approaches for more than a few commercially important tree species. Hence, it is important to find a compromise between using simplistic parameterizations and expanding gap models with physiology-based functions and parameters that are difficult to estimate. While the modeling of tree growth has received a lot of attention over the past years, much less effort has been spent on improving the formulations of tree establishment and mortality, although these processes are likely to be just as sensitive to global change as tree growth itself. Finally, model validation issues are discussed, and it is found that there is no single data source that can reliably be used for evaluating the behavior of forest gap models; instead, I propose a combination of sensitivity analyses, qualitative examinations of process formulations, and quantitative tests of gap models or selected submodels against various kinds of empirical data to evaluate the usefulness of these models for assessing their utility for predicting the impacts of global change on long-term forest dynamics. },

@article{Arii2008,
abstract = {There is growing interest in using spatially explicit, individual-based forest simulation models to explore the ecological and silvicultural consequences of various harvesting regimes. However, simulating the dynamics of managed forests requires harvesting algorithms capable of accurately mimicking the harvest regimes of interest. Under selection silviculture, trees are harvested individually or in small groups, with the aim of retaining trees across a full range of size classes. An algorithm that reproduces selection harvesting must therefore be able to recreate both the spatial and the structural patterns of harvest. Here we introduce a selection harvest algorithm that simulates harvests as a contagious spatial process in which the cutting of one tree affects the probability that neighboring trees are also cut. Three simple and intuitive parameters are required to implement this process: (1) the probability of cutting a “target” tree (Pt) (often a function of tree size), (2) the probability of cutting its nearest neighbor (Pn), and (3) the total number of target trees to cut (Nt). Specification of these parameters allows representation of both the spatial and the structural patterns of harvest expected under selection silviculture. Based on this simple process, we built two different versions of the harvesting algorithm. An “empirical” algorithm was designed and calibrated to reproduce the observed spatial and size distribution of stumps (harvested trees) at a study site in central Ontario, and was successful in reproducing harvesting patterns found in the field, notably variability in the cluster size of harvested trees. The “user-defined” algorithm implements alternative harvesting regimes (user-defined harvest targets), which may differ in the intensity of harvesting, the size-specificity of harvesting, and the spatial pattern of harvesting. We show that the user-defined harvesting algorithm succeeds in meeting harvest targets specified by the user (e.g., size class distribution and basal area of trees harvested), while simultaneously adjusting the gap size specified (i.e., the distribution of harvested trees per cluster). Incorporation of this harvesting algorithm into spatially explicit, individual-based models will permit analyses of long-term responses of forest stands to harvesting scenarios that more realistically capture the complex patterns of within-stand variability generated by selection silviculture as practiced in actual managed forests.},

abstract = {* • Shade tolerance is the central paradigm for understanding forest succession and dynamics, but there is considerable debate as to what the salient features of shade tolerance are, whether adult leaves show similar shade adaptations to seedling leaves, and whether the same leaf adaptations are found in forests under different climatic control.
* • Here, adult leaf and metamer traits were measured for 39 tree species from a tropical moist semi-evergreen forest (1580 mm rain yr−1) and 41 species from a dry deciduous forest (1160 mm yr−1) in Bolivia. Twenty-six functional traits were measured and related to species regeneration light requirements.
* • Adult leaf traits were clearly associated with shade tolerance. Different, rather than stronger, shade adaptations were found for moist compared with dry forest species. Shade adaptations exclusively found in the evergreen moist forest were related to tough and persistent leaves, and shade adaptations in the dry deciduous forest were related to high light interception and water use.
* • These results suggest that, for forests differing in rainfall seasonality, there is a shift in the relative importance of functional leaf traits and performance trade-offs that control light partitioning. In the moist evergreen forest leaf traits underlying the growth–survival trade-off are important, whereas in the seasonally deciduous forest leaf traits underlying the growth trade-off between low and high light might become important.},

* 6Leaves from the closed canopy dry monsoon forest had significantly larger Amass, chlorophyll and P contents than did leaves from the three open canopy habitats (eucalypt open forest, mixed woodland and Melaleuca swamp). This reflected the relatively low proportions of evergreen and Myrtaceous species in the dry monsoon forest. There were also significant intraspecific differences among habitats.

abstract = {We developed interpolated climate surfaces for global land areas (excluding Antarctica) at a spatial resolution of 30 arc s (often referred to as 1-km spatial resolution). The climate elements considered were monthly precipitation and mean, minimum, and maximum temperature. Input data were gathered from a variety of sources and, where possible, were restricted to records from the 1950–2000 period. We used the thin-plate smoothing spline algorithm implemented in the ANUSPLIN package for interpolation, using latitude, longitude, and elevation as independent variables. We quantified uncertainty arising from the input data and the interpolation by mapping weather station density, elevation bias in the weather stations, and elevation variation within grid cells and through data partitioning and cross validation. Elevation bias tended to be negative (stations lower than expected) at high latitudes but positive in the tropics. Uncertainty is highest in mountainous and in poorly sampled areas. Data partitioning showed high uncertainty of the surfaces on isolated islands, e.g. in the Pacific. Aggregating the elevation and climate data to 10 arc min resolution showed an enormous variation within grid cells, illustrating the value of high-resolution surfaces. A comparison with an existing data set at 10 arc min resolution showed overall agreement, but with significant variation in some regions. A comparison with two high-resolution data sets for the United States also identified areas with large local differences, particularly in mountainous areas. Compared to previous global climatologies, ours has the following advantages: the data are at a higher spatial resolution (400 times greater or more); more weather station records were used; improved elevation data were used; and more information about spatial patterns of uncertainty in the data is available. Owing to the overall low density of available climate stations, our surfaces do not capture of all variation that may occur at a resolution of 1 km, particularly of precipitation in mountainous areas. In future work, such variation might be captured through knowledge-based methods and inclusion of additional co-variates, particularly layers obtained through remote sensing.

abstract = {Assessing trait responses to environmental gradients requires the simultaneous analysis of the information contained in three tables: L (species distribution across samples), R (environmental characteristics of samples), and Q (species traits). Among the available methods, the so-called fourth-corner and RLQ methods are two appealing alternatives that provide a direct way to test and estimate trait–environment relationships. Both methods are based on the analysis of the fourth-corner matrix, which crosses traits and environmental variables weighted by species abundances. However, they differ greatly in their outputs: RLQ is a multivariate technique that provides ordination scores to summarize the joint structure among the three tables, whereas the fourth-corner method mainly tests for individual trait–environment relationships (i.e., one trait and one environmental variable at a time). Here, we illustrate how the complementarity between these two methods can be exploited to promote new ecological knowledge and to improve the study of trait–environment relationships. After a short description of each method, we apply them to real ecological data to present their different outputs and provide hints about the gain resulting from their combined use.},

@article{Biswas2016,
abstract = {Functional trait diversity is a popular tool in modern ecology, mainly used to infer assembly processes and ecosystem functioning. Patterns of functional trait diversity are shaped by ecological processes such as environmental filtering, species interactions and dispersal that are inherently spatial, and different processes may operate at different spatial scales. Adding a spatial dimension to the analysis of functional trait diversity may thus increase our ability to infer community assembly processes and to predict change in assembly processes following disturbance or land-use change. Richness, evenness and divergence of functional traits are commonly used indices of functional trait diversity that are known to respond differently to large-scale filters related to environmental heterogeneity and dispersal and fine-scale filters related to species interactions (competition). Recent developments in spatial statistics make it possible to separately quantify large-scale patterns (variation in local means) and fine-scale patterns (variation around local means) by decomposing overall spatial autocorrelation quantified by Moran's coefficient into its positive and negative components using Moran eigenvector maps (MEM). We thus propose to identify the spatial signature of multiple ecological processes that are potentially acting at different spatial scales by contrasting positive and negative components of spatial autocorrelation for each of the three indices of functional trait diversity. We illustrate this approach with a case study from riparian plant communities, where we test the effects of disturbance on spatial patterns of functional trait diversity. The fine-scale pattern of all three indices was increased in the disturbed versus control habitat, suggesting an increase in local scale competition and an overall increase in unexplained variance in the post-disturbance versus control community. Further research using simulation modeling should focus on establishing the proposed link between community assembly rules and spatial patterns of functional trait diversity to maximize our ability to infer multiple processes from spatial community structure.},

abstract = {* Collecting leaves or seeds from tall trees is a difficult task that many plant physiologists, ecologists, geneticists and forest managers encounter repeatedly. Tree branches are often much higher than a cutting pole or saw can reach. When this happens, the most common solutions involve the use of sharp-shooters, cherry pickers (a.k.a. bucket trucks) or tree climbers. All of these methods can be expense, logistically complicated, and often involve additional permits and licences.


* We present a cost-effective and simple alternative for collecting leaves and seeds from tall trees using an arborist throw-line launcher. An arborist throw-line launcher is traditionally used to throw a rope over high branches for tree climbing. However, the same instrument can be used to collect leaves and seeds from trees without the need for climbing.


* In the course of sampling over 4000 trees from a variety of species across multiple continents, we have developed several techniques to optimize leaf and seed sampling with a throw-line launcher at heights up to 40 m. We present these techniques along with several time-saving tips and tricks to increase sampling efficiency and reduce the occurrence of lost weight bags, broken ropes, and hung branches that will not fall.


* These techniques remove many of the limitations commonly associated with sampling leaves and seeds from tall trees with more traditional methods. Without these limitations, the costs, risks and time associated with this type of data collection are reduced.},

abstract = {The assimilation of carbon by plant communities (gross primary production [GPP]) is a central concern in plant ecology as well as for our understanding of global climate change. As an alternative to traditional methods involving destructive harvests or time-consuming measurements, we present a simple, general model for GPP as the product of the lifetime carbon gain by a single leaf, the daily leaf production rate, and the length of the favorable period for photosynthesis. To test the model, we estimated leaf lifetime carbon gain for 26 species using the concept of mean labor time for leaves (the part of each day the leaf functions to full capacity), average potential photosynthetic capacity over the leaf lifetime, and functional leaf longevity (leaf longevity discounted for periods within a year wholly unfavorable for photosynthesis). We found that the lifetime carbon gain of leaves was rather constant across species. Moreover, when foliar biomass was regressed against functional leaf longevity, aseasonal and seasonal forests fell on a single line, suggesting that the leaf production rate during favorable periods is not substantially different among forests in the world. The gross production of forest ecosystems then can be predicted to a first approximation simply by the annual duration of the period favorable for photosynthetic activity in any given region.},

@article{Hooper2005,
abstract = {Humans are altering the composition of biological communities through a variety of activities that increase rates of species invasions and species extinctions, at all scales, from local to global. These changes in components of the Earth's biodiversity cause concern for ethical and aesthetic reasons, but they also have a strong potential to alter ecosystem properties and the goods and services they provide to humanity. Ecological experiments, observations, and theoretical developments show that ecosystem properties depend greatly on biodiversity in terms of the functional characteristics of organisms present in the ecosystem and the distribution and abundance of those organisms over space and time. Species effects act in concert with the effects of climate, resource availability, and disturbance regimes in influencing ecosystem properties. Human activities can modify all of the above factors; here we focus on modification of these biotic controls. The scientific community has come to a broad consensus on many aspects of the re- lationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, including many points relevant to management of ecosystems. Further progress will require integration of knowledge about biotic and abiotic controls on ecosystem properties, how ecological communities are struc- tured, and the forces driving species extinctions and invasions. To strengthen links to policy and management, we also need to integrate our ecological knowledge with understanding of the social and economic constraints of potential management practices. Understanding this complexity, while taking strong steps to minimize current losses of species, is necessary for responsible management of Earth's ecosystems and the diverse biota they contain.},

@article{coomes_scaling_2008,
abstract = {General models of plant vascular architecture, based on scaling of pipe diameters to remove the length dependence of hydraulic resistance within the xylem, have attracted strong interest. However, these models have neglected to consider the leaf, an important hydraulic component; they assume all leaves to have similar hydraulic properties, including similar pipe diameters in the petiole. We examine the scaling of the leaf xylem in 10 temperate oak species, an important hydraulic component. The mean hydraulic diameter of petiole xylem vessels varied by 30{\%} among the 10 oak species. Conduit diameters narrowed from the petiole to the midrib to the secondary veins, consistent with resistance minimization, but the power function scaling exponent differed from that predicted for stems. Leaf size was an organizing trait within and across species. These findings indicate that leaf vasculature needs to be included in whole-plant scaling models, for these to accurately reflect and predict whole-plant transport and its implications for performance and ecology.},

@article{Tilman1999,
abstract = {This paper uses theory and experiments to explore the effects of diversity on stability, productivity, and susceptibility to invasion. A model of resource competition predicts that increases in diversity cause community stability to increase, but population stability to decrease. These opposite effects are, to a great extent, explained by how temporal variances in species abundances scale with mean abundance, and by the differential impact of this scaling on population vs. community stability. Community stability also depends on a negative covariance effect (competitive compensation) and on overyielding (ecosystem productivity increasing with diversity). A long-term study in Minnesota grasslands supports these predictions. Models of competition predict, and field experiments confirm, that greater plant diversity leads to greater primary productivity. This diversity-productivity relationship results both from the greater chance that a more productive species would be present at higher diversity (the sampling effect) and from the better "coverage" of habitat heterogeneity caused by the broader range of species traits in a more diverse community (the niche differentiation effect). Both effects cause more complete utilization of limiting resources at higher diversity, which increases resource retention, further increasing productivity. Finally, lower levels of available limiting resources at higher diversity are predicted to decrease the susceptibility of an ecosystem to invasion, supporting the diversity-invasibility hypothesis. This mechanism provides rules for community assembly and invasion resistance. In total, biodiversity should be added to species composition, disturbance, nutrient supply, and climate as a major controller of population and ecosystem dynamics and structure. By their increasingly great directional impacts on all of these controllers, humans are likely to cause major long-term changes in the functioning of ecosystems worldwide. A better understanding of these ecosystem changes is needed if ecologists are to provide society with the knowledge essential for wise management of the earth and its biological resources.},

abstract = {Two different approaches currently prevail for predicting spatial patterns of species assemblages. The first approach (macroecological modelling, MEM) focuses directly on realized properties of species assemblages, whereas the second approach (stacked species distribution modelling, S-SDM) starts with constituent species to approximate the properties of assemblages. Here, we propose to unify the two approaches in a single 'spatially explicit species assemblage modelling' (SESAM) framework. This framework uses relevant designations of initial species source pools for modelling, macroecological variables, and ecological assembly rules to constrain predictions of the richness and composition of species assemblages obtained by stacking predictions of individual species distributions. We believe that such a framework could prove useful in many theoretical and applied disciplines of ecology and evolution, both for improving our basic understanding of species assembly across spatio-temporal scales and for anticipating expected consequences of local, regional or global environmental changes. In this paper, we propose such a framework and call for further developments and testing across a broad range of community types in a variety of environments},

abstract = {Phylogenetic comparative methods have long considered phylogenetic signal as a source of statistical bias in the correlative analysis of biological traits. However, the main life-history strategies existing in a set of taxa are often combinations of life history traits that are inherently phylogenetically structured. In this paper, we present a method for identifying evolutionary strategies from large sets of biological traits, using phylogeny as a source of meaningful historical and ecological information. Our methodology extends a multivariate method developed for the analysis of spatial patterns, and relies on finding combinations of traits that are phylogenetically autocorrelated. Using extensive simulations, we show that our method efficiently uncovers phylogenetic structures with respect to various tree topologies, and remains powerful in cases where a large majority of traits are not phylogenetically structured. Our methodology is illustrated using empirical data, and implemented in the adephylo package for the free software R.},

abstract = {Species diversity of vascular epiphyte plant communities was studied in La Carbonera, a montane rain forest dominated by Podocarpaceae in the Venezuelan Andes. We compared the epiphyte communities of the primary, disturbed, and secondary forest areas of La Carbonera in order to augment the scarce knowledge on the effects of anthropogenic disturbance on these important elements of tropical vegetation. Diversity of vascular epiphytes (191 species in the whole forest area) was low in the disturbed and secondary areas (81 spp.) compared to adjacent primary forest (178 spp.). Four types of disturbed forest and secondary vegetation supported different numbers of epiphyte species, showing a decline with increasing degrees of disturbance (65 spp. along a road transect, 42 spp. on relict trees in disturbed forest, 13 spp. in a tree plantation and 7 spp. in a former clearing, both secondary vegetation units). Epiphytic species composition in primary and disturbed or secondary forest areas differed markedly: disturbed habitats harboured fewer fern and orchid species but more bromeliad species than the primary forest. Probably the families occurring only in primary forest sites of our study may be useful as bioindicators to determine the degree of disturbance in other habitats of mountain rain forests as well. Epiphyte abundance was also lower in disturbed habitats: a remnant emergent tree supported only about half as many epiphyte individuals as a member of the same species of similar size in the primary forest. The decrease in species numbers and abundance as well as the differences in species composition are mainly due to the less diverse phorophyte structure and less differentiated microclimate in the disturbed and secondary vegetation compared to the primary forest.},

abstract = {Competition for light, treefall gap formation and recruitment are the critical phenomena in the genesis of tropical rain forests. These aspects are taken into account to build a new spatially explicit forest growth model called TROLL. Competition for light is modelled by calculating exactly the three-dimensional field of photosynthetically active radiation in the forest understorey. Typically, 106 light intensities are computed per hectare at each time step. This light field controls the growth of each tree and establishment/death events. Seed dispersal, dormancy and establishment success as well as a model of treefalls are also included. A special care is paid to the justification and to the validation of each of these modules. The TROLL model is parameterized for a Neotropical rain forest in French Guiana using 12 functional groups of species. Using this model the vertical canopy structure and the tree diametric distribution are investigated. The role of treefalls in maintaining pioneer species is also evidenced. A forest succession scenario is simulated and compared to field data. The model is then used to simulate the recolonization of a previously sterilized area by a rain forest plant community. This scenario is interpreted using information available from palaeorecords over the Holocene period and their validity is discussed. It is suggested that this model could be used to study mosaic-like patterns in rain forests, installation of slowly dispersing species, speciation hypotheses and landscape scale dynamics of rain forests.},

The two-dimensional space-filling of the growing crowns of the tallest individuals relegates a group of losing, slow-growing individuals to the understory. Those left in the understory follow a power-law size distribution, the scaling of which depends on only the crown area-to-diameter allometry exponent: a well-conserved value across tropical forests.},

abstract = {Understanding the processes shaping biological communities under multiple disturbances is a core challenge in ecology and conservation science. Traditionally, ecologists have explored linkages between the severity and type of disturbance and the taxonomic structure of communities. Recent advances in the application of species traits, to assess the functional structure of communities, have provided an alternative approach that responds rapidly and consistently across taxa and ecosystems to multiple disturbances. Importantly, trait-based metrics may provide advanced warning of disturbance to ecosystems because they do not need species loss to be reactive. Here, we synthesize empirical evidence and present a theoretical framework, based on species positions in a functional space, as a tool to reveal the complex nature of change in disturbed ecosystems.},

abstract = {P{\textgreater}1. Modelling growth strategies among tropical trees is an important objective in predicting the response of tree dynamics to selective logging and in gaining insights into the ecological processes that structure tree communities in managed tropical forests. 2. We developed a disturbance index to model the effects of distance to and area of logging gaps on stem radial growth rates. This index was tested using census data of 43 neotropical tree species, representing a variety of life-history strategies and developmental stages, from a selectively logged forest at Paracou, French Guiana. Growth strategies were analyzed in light of two indicators: the inherent species growth rate (when disturbance index is null) and the species reaction (change in growth rate) to logging gaps. 3. Across species, the predicted inherent growth rates in unlogged forest ranged from 0 center dot 25 to 6 center dot 47 mm year-1, with an average growth of 2 center dot 29 mm year-1. Ontogenetic shifts in inherent growth rate were found in 26 of the 43 species. 4. Species growth response to logging gaps varied widely among species but was significantly positive for 27 species. The effect of ontogeny on growth response to logging was retained for 14 species, and species with inherent fast growth rate (5 mm year-1) responded less to logging gap disturbances than did species with slow inherent growth (1 mm year-1). 5. Functional traits explained 19-42{\%} of the variation in the inherent growth rate and in species' response across all developmental stages. Whereas maximum diameters and seed mass were strong predictors of inherent growth rate, maximum height, wood density, mode of germination and stem architecture were additionally involved in tree growth response. 6. Synthesis and applications: This study provides a necessary framework for developing predictive post-logging growth models for the thousands of species comprising tropical forests and is sufficiently general to apply to a broad range of managed tropical forests.},

abstract = {Statistical models of the realized niche of species are increasingly used, but systematic comparisons of alternative methods are still limited. In particular, only few studies have explored the effect of scale in model outputs. In this paper, we investigate the predictive ability of three statistical methods (generalized linear models, generalized additive models and classification tree analysis) using species distribution data at three scales: fine (Catalonia), intermediate (Portugal) and coarse (Europe). Four Mediterranean tree species were modelled for comparison. Variables selected by models were relatively consistent across scales and the predictive accuracy of models varied only slightly. However, there were slight differences in the performance of methods. Classification tree analysis had a lower accuracy than the generalized methods, especially at finer scales. The performance of generalized linear models also increased with scale. At the fine scale GLM with linear terms showed better accuracy than GLM with quadratic and polynomial terms. This is probably because distributions at finer scales represent a linear sub-sample of entire realized niches of species. In contrast to GLM, the performance of GAM was constant across scales being more data-oriented. The predictive accuracy of GAM was always at least equal to other techniques, suggesting that this modelling approach is more robust to variations of scale because it can deal with any response shape.

Amazonian forests strongly influence regional and global climates and therefore any changes in forest structure, such as deforestation or die-back, may create positive feedback on externally forced climate change. Monitoring, modelling and managing the impacts of anthropogenic climate change on forest dynamics is therefore an important objective of forest researchers, and one that requires long-term data on changes at the level of community, populations and phenotypes. In this paper we provide the most comprehensive study yet on the seasonal dynamics of various leaf traits: leaf area index (LAI), leaf mortality (LM), leaf biomass (LB), leaf growth rate (LG), and leaf residence time (TR) from 50 experimental plots in a forest site at Belterra, Par??

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Calibration of terrestrial ecosystem models is important but challenging. Bayesian inference implemented by Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling provides a comprehensive framework to estimate model parameters and associated uncertainties using their posterior distributions. The effectiveness and efficiency of the method strongly depend on the MCMC algorithm used. In this study, a Differential Evolution Adaptive Metropolis (DREAM) algorithm was used to estimate posterior distributions of 21 parameters for the data assimilation linked ecosystem carbon (DALEC) model using 14 years of daily net ecosystem exchange data collected at the Harvard Forest Environmental Measurement Site eddy-flux tower. The DREAM is a multi-chain method and uses differential evolution technique for chain movement, allowing it to be efficiently applied to high-dimensional problems, and can reliably estimate heavy-tailed and multimodal distributions that are difficult for single-chain schemes using a Gaussian proposal distribution. The results were evaluated against the popular Adaptive Metropolis (AM) scheme. DREAM indicated that two parameters controlling autumn phenology have multiple modes in their posterior distributions while AM only identified one mode. The calibration of DREAM resulted in a better model fit and predictive performance compared to the AM. DREAM provides means for a good exploration of the posterior distributions of model parameters. It reduces the risk of false convergence to a local optimum and potentially improves the predictive performance of the calibrated model.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Tree vigor is often used as a covariate when tree mortality is predicted from tree growth in tropical forest dynamic models, but it is rarely explicitly accounted for in a coherent modeling framework. We quantify tree vigor at the individual tree level, based on the difference between expected and observed growth. The available methods to join nonlinear tree growth and mortality processes are not commonly used by forest ecologists so that we develop an inference methodology based on an MCMC approach, allowing us to sample the parameters of the growth and mortality model according to their posterior distribution using the joint model likelihood. We apply our framework to a set of data on the 20-year dynamics of a forest in Paracou, French Guiana, taking advantage of functional trait-based growth and mortality models already developed independently. Our results showed that growth and mortality are intimately linked and that the vigor estimator is an essential predictor of mortality, highlighting that trees growing more than expected have a far lower probability of dying. Our joint model methodology is sufficiently generic to be used to join two longitudinal and punctual linked processes and thus may be applied to a wide range of growth and mortality models. In the context of global changes, such joint models are urgently needed in tropical forests to analyze, and then predict, the effects of the ongoing changes on the tree dynamics in hyperdiverse tropical forests.},

In woody plant communities of coastal California, beta trait values for specific leaf area, leaf size, wood density and maximum height all covary strongly, reflecting species distributions across a gradient of soil moisture availability. Alpha values, on the other hand, are generally not significantly correlated, suggesting several independent axes of differentiation within communities.

It was found that the probability of successful replication of Commelina communis L. stomata depended on the width of the stomatal pores. The wider pores in a sample were more likely to be measured, so the resulting estimated mean was an overestimate of the true mean. This bias in estimates of stomatal aperture from impressions was studied and quantified. A transformation is described which was used to adjust apparent aperture measurements from impressions to give more accurate estimates of stomatal apertures on intact leaves of C. communis. Maximum absolute errors due to the bias usually occurred at apparent apertures on impressions of between 2 and 5 $\mu$m but were proportionally greatest below 3$\mu$m, where they often exceeded 40{\%}. At a given aperture, the error depended upon the dispersion of the stomatal apertures about their mean and was greatest when this was large.},

abstract = {a b s t r a c t Across forest ecosystems worldwide, alternative silvicultural practices such as partial or " structural reten-tion " harvesting are gaining increasing use as means to balance economic and ecological management goals. Recent studies have documented highly elevated rates of residual-tree mortality and growth, both of which are likely to influence post-harvest stand development. Explicit consideration of residual-tree responses to partial harvest is therefore required to make accurate growth and yield predictions. In this paper we incorporate empirically based, spatially explicit tree growth and mortality predictors into a for-est simulation model in order to quantify stand dynamics following a range of simulated partial harvests. We consider lowland black spruce boreal forests and use a common strip-cutting technique, Harvest with Advance Regeneration Protection, as a reference against which to compare alternative scenarios. Predicted stand development proceeded most rapidly in scenarios with reduced skidding impacts and rel-atively high levels of retention, since these treatments were associated with lower residual-tree mortality rates and larger growing stocks respectively. Stand development was also influenced on a proportional basis by residual-tree growth rates, which increased with declining neighbourhood competition. Across a range of harvest scenarios with equivalent retention levels (20{\%}), differences in residual-tree responses among treatments led to a 35-year range in projected basal area return intervals (70–105 years). Our results demonstrate that short-term responses of residual trees affect stand development rates over long ({\textgreater}100-year) time scales, and show that post-harvest stand recovery rates are influenced not only by the retention level but also by the specific parameters of partial harvest prescriptions, including the layout of skid trails and the spatial arrangement of residual trees. Results from this study provide essential infor-mation for evaluating partial harvests in the black spruce boreal forest and supply modelling tools for assessing alternative silvicultural treatments in other forest ecosystems.},

abstract = {* 1Statistical modelling is often used to relate sparse biological survey data to remotely derived environmental predictors, thereby providing a basis for predictively mapping biodiversity across an entire region of interest. The most popular strategy for such modelling has been to model distributions of individual species one at a time. Spatial modelling of biodiversity at the community level may, however, confer significant benefits for applications involving very large numbers of species, particularly if many of these species are recorded infrequently.
* 2Community-level modelling combines data from multiple species and produces information on spatial pattern in the distribution of biodiversity at a collective community level instead of, or in addition to, the level of individual species. Spatial outputs from community-level modelling include predictive mapping of community types (groups of locations with similar species composition), species groups (groups of species with similar distributions), axes or gradients of compositional variation, levels of compositional dissimilarity between pairs of locations, and various macro-ecological properties (e.g. species richness).
* 3Three broad modelling strategies can be used to generate these outputs: (i) ‘assemble first, predict later', in which biological survey data are first classified, ordinated or aggregated to produce community-level entities or attributes that are then modelled in relation to environmental predictors; (ii) ‘predict first, assemble later', in which individual species are modelled one at a time as a function of environmental variables, to produce a stack of species distribution maps that is then subjected to classification, ordination or aggregation; and (iii) ‘assemble and predict together', in which all species are modelled simultaneously, within a single integrated modelling process. These strategies each have particular strengths and weaknesses, depending on the intended purpose of modelling and the type, quality and quantity of data involved.
* 4Synthesis and applications. The potential benefits of modelling large multispecies data sets using community-level, as opposed to species-level, approaches include faster processing, increased power to detect shared patterns of environmental response across rarely recorded species, and enhanced capacity to synthesize complex data into a form more readily interpretable by scientists and decision-makers. Community-level modelling therefore deserves to be considered more often, and more widely, as a potential alternative or supplement to modelling individual species.},

@article{Borgy2017,
abstract = {One of the fundamental challenges in ecology is to identify the signature of assembly mechanisms result- ing from patterns of community composition. For this purpose, the trait-based approach has promoted the analysis of functional trait distributions within communities. Until now, much attention has been paid to the design of appropriate null models and the definition of relevant functional metrics for infer- ring community assembly mechanisms from trait distributions. However, less consideration were given to the set of methodological choices preceding the statistical analysis – i.e. from designing a sampling scheme to measuring traits – and how likely they influence the conclusions drawn, as this may subject the analysis to methodological biases. In this regard, a comprehensive perspective on how the overall set of methodological choices influence the inference of community assembly mechanisms is needed. We extensively reviewed recent studies that have addressed animal and plant community assembly by applying a trait-based null model approach. We analyzed how the set of methodological choices in these studies depended on the mechanisms of interest and how they could influence the conclusions drawn by the authors. We found that methodological choices only weakly depended on the hypothesized assembly mechanisms studied by the authors, especially because the two main assembly mechanisms hypothesized, i.e. environmental filtering and limiting similarity, were often tested based on a common experimental design. In contrast, the detection of assembly mechanisms was strongly dependent on the sampling scale, the type of data, the origin of trait values and the delineation of the reference species pool, while less affected by the null model and the functional metrics chosen. These results underline plausible methodological biases in favor of the detection of certain mechanisms to the detriment of others. In addition, there was a significant relationship between the predominant mechanisms concluded by the authors and the type of organism used as biological model, suggesting either that the methodological choices depend on a common strategy used by the different authors when studying similar biological models, or that the methodological choices depended on certain particular properties of the organisms. From this extensive review, we highlight major conceptual and methodological issues that need to be addressed in trait-based null model approaches. We synthesize the methodological choices relevant to study several assembly mechanisms while minimizing methodological biases. We then derive practical guidelines and emphasize the importance of spatial structure in sampling strategy and null model design, because of the scale-dependent signatures of ecological processes.},

We used: (1) five methods to create bS-SDM predictions; (2) two approaches for predicting species richness, by summing individual SDM probabilities or by modelling the number of species (i.e. richness) directly; and (3) five different biotic rules based either on ranking probabilities from SDMs or on community co-occurrence patterns. Combining these various options resulted in 47 implementations for each taxon.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nResults$\backslash$nSpecies richness of the two taxonomic groups was predicted with good accuracy overall, and in most cases bS-SDM did not produce a biased prediction exceeding the actual number of species in each unit. In the prediction of community composition bS-SDM often also yielded the best evaluation score. In the case of poor performance of bS-SDM (i.e. when bS-SDM overestimated the prediction of richness) the SESAM framework improved predictions of species composition.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMain conclusions$\backslash$nOur results differed from previous findings using community-level models. First, we show that overprediction of richness by bS-SDM is not a general rule, thus highlighting the relevance of producing good individual SDMs to capture the ecological filters that are important for the assembly process. Second, we confirm the potential of SESAM when richness is overpredicted by bS-SDM; limiting the number of species for each unit and applying biotic rules (here using the ranking of SDM probabilities) can improve predictions of species composition.$\backslash$n},

@article{Loreau2001,
abstract = {The impact of biodiversity loss on the functioning of ecosystems and their ability to provide ecological services has become a central issue in ecology. Several experiments have provided evidence that reduced species diversity may impair ecosystem processes such as plant biomass production. The interpretation of these experiments, however, has been controversial because two types of mechanism may operate in combination. In the 'selection effect', dominance by species with particular traits affects ecosystem processes. In the 'complementarity effect', resource partitioning or positive interactions lead to increased total resource use. Here we present a new approach to separate the two effects on the basis of an additive partitioning analogous to the Price equation in evolutionary genetics. Applying this method to data from the pan-European BIODEPTH experiment reveals that the selection effect is zero on average and varies from negative to positive in different localities, depending on whether species with lower- or higher-than-average biomass dominate communities. In contrast, the complementarity effect is positive overall, supporting the hypothesis that plant diversity influences primary production in European grasslands through niche differentiation or facilitation.},

abstract = {* 1Analysing the phylogenetic structure of natural communities may illuminate the processes governing the assembly and coexistence of species in ecological communities.
* 2Unifying previous works, we present a statistical framework to quantify the phylogenetic structure of communities in terms of average divergence time between pairs of individuals or species, sampled from different sites. This framework allows an additive partitioning of the phylogenetic signal into alpha (within-site) and beta (among-site) components, and is closely linked to Simpson diversity. It unifies the treatment of intraspecific (genetic) and interspecific diversity, leading to the definition of differentiation coefficients among community samples (e.g. IST, PST) analogous to classical population genetics coefficients expressing differentiation among populations (e.g. FST, NST).
* 3Two coefficients which express community differentiation among sites from species identity (IST) or species phylogeny (PST) require abundance data (number of individuals per species per site), and estimators that are unbiased with respect to sample size are given. Another coefficient ($\Pi$ST) expresses the gain of the mean phylogenetic distance between species found in different sites compared with species found within sites, and requires only incidence data (presence/absence of each species in each site).
* 4We present tests based on phylogenetic tree randomizations to detect community phylogenetic clustering (PST {\{}{\textgreater}{\}} IST or $\Pi$ST {\{}{\textgreater}{\}} 0) or phylogenetic overdispersion (PST {\{}{\textless}{\}} IST or $\Pi$ST {\{}{\textless}{\}} 0). In addition, we propose a novel approach to detect phylogenetic clustering or overdispersion in different clades or at different evolutionary time depths using partial randomizations.
* 5IST, PST or $\Pi$ST can also be used as distances between community samples and regressed on ecological or geographical distances, allowing us to investigate the factors responsible for the phylogenetic signal and the critical scales at which it appears.
* 6We illustrate the approach on forest tree communities in Equatorial Guinea, where a phylogenetic clustering signal was probably due to phylogenetically conserved adaptations to the elevation gradient and was mostly contributed to by ancient clade subdivisions.
* 7The approach presented should find applications for comparing quantitatively phylogenetic patterns of different communities, of similar communities in different regions or continents, or of populations (within species) vs. communities (among species).},

@article{blonder_leaf-area_2012,
abstract = {• Premise of the Study: Leaf area is a key trait that links plant form, function, and environment. Measures of leaf area can be biased because leaf area is often estimated from dried or fossilized specimens that have shrunk by an unknown amount. We tested the common assumption that this shrinkage is negligible.
• Methods: We measured shrinkage by comparing dry and fresh leaf area in 3401 leaves of 380 temperate and tropical species and used phylogenetic and trait-based approaches to determine predictors of this shrinkage. We also tested the effects of rehydration and simulated fossilization on shrinkage in four species.
• Key Results: We found that dried leaves shrink in area by an average of 22{\%} and a maximum of 82{\%}. Shrinkage in dried leaves can be predicted by multiple morphological traits with a standard deviation of 7.8{\%}. We also found that mud burial, a proxy for compression fossilization, caused negligible shrinkage, and that rehydration, a potential treatment of dried herbarium specimens, eliminated shrinkage.
• Conclusions: Our findings indicate that the amount of shrinkage is driven by variation in leaf area, leaf thickness, evergreenness, and woodiness and can be reversed by rehydration. The amount of shrinkage may also be a useful trait related to ecologically and physiological differences in drought tolerance and plant life history.},

We review the current state of knowledge on the impacts of plantation forestry on genetic and species diversity at different spatial scales and discuss the economic and ecological implications of biodiversity management within plantation stands and landscapes. Managing plantations to produce goods such as timber while also enhancing ecological services such as biodiversity involves tradeoffs, which can be made only with a clear understanding of the ecological context of plantations in the broader landscape and agreement among stakeholders on the desired balance of goods and ecological services from plantations.},

One of the main goals of these plots has been to evaluate spatial patterns in tropical tree populations. Here the degree of aggregation in the distribution of 1768 tree species is examined based on the average density of conspecific trees in circular neighborhoods around each tree. When all individuals larger than 1 centimeter in stem diameter were included, nearly every species was more aggregated than a random distribution. Considering only larger trees (greater than or equal to 10 centimeters in diameter), the pattern persisted, with most species being more aggregated than random. Rare species were more aggregated than common species. All six forests were very similar in all the particulars of these results.},

abstract = {* The role of plant sexual systems in community assembly has been little studied. Classical assumptions predict an association between self-fertilization and colonizing ability, a pattern not systematically supported by observations.


* Here, using a data set of 626 462 trees sampled throughout 8300 km2 in central Africa and historical information collected 60 years ago on forest successional status, we compare sexual system assemblages between young successional and mature communities.


* We use two multivariate approaches to assess the variation in community dioecism between successional status, while controlling for covariation between dioecy and six other traits usually considered as good proxies for important functions in forest successional dynamics.


* We show that dioecious trees are significantly overrepresented in young successional areas, contrary to classical expectations. This robust pattern is unlikely to be driven by soil conditions, by the other associated traits or by species-specific abundance. Strikingly, dioecy was one of the traits most correlated with young successional areas.


* These results show that sexual systems play an important role in community assembly. The higher occurrence of dioecy in young successional areas is likely due to a higher relative seed fitness of dioecious species in more stressful conditions or by an evolutionary-driven association between dioecy and colonization ability, as predicted by theoretical studies.


* Synthesis. Our study emphasizes an overlooked association between sexual system and community assembly and emphasizes the need to revisit classical assumptions regarding that relationship.},

@article{Calabrese2014,
abstract = {Aim Species distribution models (SDMs) are common tools in biogeography and conservation ecology. It has been repeatedly claimed that aggregated (stacked) SDMs (S-SDMs) will overestimate species richness. One recently suggested solution to this problem is to use macroecological models of species richness to constrain S-SDMs. Here, we examine current practice in the development of S-SDMs to identify methodological problems, provide tools to overcome these issues, and quantify the performance of correctly stacked S-SDMs alongside macroecological models. Locations Barents Sea, Europe and Dutch Wadden Sea. Methods We present formal mathematical arguments demonstrating how S-SDMs should and should not be stacked. We then compare the performance of macroecological models and correctly stacked S-SDMs on the same data to determine if the former can be used to constrain the latter. Next, we develop a maximum-likelihood approach to adjusting S-SDMs and discuss how it could potentially be used in combination with macroecological models. Finally, we use this tool to quantify how S-SDMs deviate from observed richness in four very different case studies. Results We demonstrate that stacking methods based on thresholding site-level occurrence probabilities will almost always be biased, and that these biases will tend toward systematic overprediction of richness. Next, we show that correctly stacked S-SDMs perform very similarly to macroecological models in that they both have a tendency to overpredict richness in species-poor sites and underpredict it in species-rich sites. Main conclusions Our results suggest that the perception that S-SDMs consistently overpredict richness is driven largely by incorrect stacking methods. With these biases removed, S-SDMs perform similarly to macroecological models, suggesting that combining the two model classes will not offer much improvement. However, if situations where coupling S-SDMs and macroecological models would be beneficial are subsequently identified, the tools we develop would facilitate such a synthesis.},

@article{hubbell_unified_1997,
abstract = {. Theories of island biogeography and of relative species abundance are of central importance in biogeography and community ecology, yet these two bodies of theory heretofore have been largely unconnected. Incorporating speciation into the theory of island biogeography unexpectedly results in unification of these two theories. The unified theory predicts the existence of a fundamental biodiversity number $\theta$ that controls not only species richness, but also relative species abundance in the source area metacommunity at equilibrium between speciation and extinction. With additional parameters for island size and migration rate, the theory also predicts relative species abundance on islands or local regions of continuous landscapes. Application of the theory to the biogeography and biodiversity of communities of tropical trees and reef-building corals are discussed. One important result is that only relatively modest migration rates are sufficient to dynamically couple the regional metacommunity and stabilize community structure on large spatiotemporal scales. Thus, regional, long-term compositional stasis in tropical rain forests and coral reefs can arise just as easily from the stabilizing effect of large numbers as from niche-assembly rules that limit species membership in communities. Because of the higher intrinsic vagility of corals, the theory predicts greater regional similarity in coral reef communities than in tropical tree communities.},

In order to use multiple logistic regression, many studies have simulated "pseudo-absences" through a number of strategies, but it is unknown how the choice of strategy influences models and their geographic predictions of species. In this paper we evaluate the effect of several prevailing pseudo-absence strategies on the predictions of the geographic distribution of a virtual species whose "true" distribution and relationship to three environmental predictors was predefined. We evaluated the effect of using a) real absences b) pseudo-absences selected randomly from the background and c) two-step approaches: pseudo-absences selected from low suitability areas predicted by either Ecological Niche Factor Analysis: (ENFA) or BIOCLIM. We compared how the choice of pseudo-absence strategy affected model fit, predictive power, and information-theoretic model selection results.},

abstract = {Ecophylogenetics can be viewed as an emerging fusion of ecology, biogeography and macroevolution. This new and fast-growing field is promoting the incorporation of evolution and historical contingencies into the ecological research agenda through the widespread use of phylogenetic data. Including phylogeny into ecological thinking represents an opportunity for biologists from different fields to collaborate and has provided promising avenues of research in both theoretical and empirical ecology, towards a better understanding of the assembly of communities, the functioning of ecosystems and their responses to environmental changes. The time is ripe to assess critically the extent to which the integration of phylogeny into these different fields of ecology has delivered on its promise. Here we review how phylogenetic information has been used to identify better the key components of species interactions with their biotic and abiotic environments, to determine the relationships between diversity and ecosystem functioning and ultimately to establish good management practices to protect overall biodiversity in the face of global change. We evaluate the relevance of information provided by phylogenies to ecologists, highlighting current potential weaknesses and needs for future developments. We suggest that despite the strong progress that has been made, a consistent unified framework is still missing to link local ecological dynamics to macroevolution.

abstract = {To determine if there were consistent differences in growth, mortality, and recruitment on slopes and ridge crests in tropical montane forests, which could explain the (frequent but not universal) low stature of trees in the ridgetop forests, we analyzed data from long-term plots in Jamaica (1990–1994; sixteen 200-m2 plots, six on ridge crests and five each on north and south slopes). Mortality was higher on north slopes, while growth and recruitment rates were not significantly different among positions. Soil pH and effects of recent disturbance by Hurricane Gilbert were positively correlated with growth and recruitment, while slope angle and disturbance effects were the best predictors of mortality. The patterns we found in Jamaica, that growth and recruitment were not higher on ridge crests than slopes, are different than those found by Herwitz and Young in Australia where growth and turnover were greater on a ridge crest. Therefore, it is not possible at present to make simple generalizations about dynamics of ridge crest versus slope forests in the montane tropics.},

Therefore, industrial-scale SFM is likely to lead to the degradation and devaluation of primary tropical forests as surely as widespread conventional unmanaged logging does today. Recent studies also show that logging in the tropics, even using SFM techniques, releases significant carbon dioxide and that carbon stocks once stored in logged timber and slash takes decades to rebuild.

@article{dray_testing_2008,
abstract = {Functional ecology aims at determining the relationships between species traits and environmental variables in order to better understand biological processes in ecosystems. From a methodological point of view, this biological objective calls for a method linking three data matrix tables: a table L with abundance or presence–absence values for species at a series of sites, a table R with variables describing the environmental conditions of the sites, and a table Q containing traits (e.g., morphological or behavioral attributes) of the species. Ten years ago, the fourth-corner method was proposed to measure and test the relationships between species traits and environmental variables using tables R, L, and Q simultaneously. In practice, this method is rarely used. The major reasons for this lack of interest are the restriction of the original method and program to presence–absence data in L and to the analysis of a single trait and a single environmental variable at a time. Moreover, ecologists often have problems in choosing a permutation model among the four originally proposed. In this paper, we revisit the fourth-corner method and propose improvements to the original approach. First, we present an extension to measure the link between species traits and environmental variables when the ecological community is described by abundance data. A new multivariate fourth-corner statistic is also proposed. Then, using numerical simulations, we discuss and evaluate the existing testing procedures. A new two-step testing procedure is presented. We hope that these elements will help ecologists use the best possible methodology to analyze this type of ecological problem.},

We examined the co-occurrence patterns of over 1100 tree species in a 25-hectare Amazonian forest plot in relation to field-measured functional traits. Using a null model approach, we show that co-occurring trees are often less ecologically similar than a niche-free (neutral) model predicts. Furthermore, we find evidence for processes that simultaneously drive convergence and divergence in key aspects of plant strategy, suggesting that at least two distinct niche-based processes are occurring. Our results show that strategy differentiation among species contributes to the maintenance of diversity in one of the most diverse tropical forests in the world.},

The rapid growth rates of light-demanding tree species have been attributed in part to their low-density, low-cost stems. We evaluated the influence of light and biomass support costs on growth rates of trees 8–25 cm in diameter at breast height (d.b.h.) among 21 species differing in wood density in two aseasonal rain forests.


*
2
Measurements of crown width, tree height, d.b.h. and wood density ($\rho$) were used to estimate the stem biomass (Ms) of a standard-sized tree (17 m tall and 16 m2 in crown area), i.e. the cost in stem biomass of supporting a given sized crown at a given height.


*
3
The species showed a three-fold range in support cost, which was highly correlated with wood density (Ms ∝ $\rho$0.77, r2 = 0.72 for the log-transformed relationship). This relationship is due to the high interspecific variation in wood density and the fact that the stem diameter of the standard-sized tree increased only slightly with decreasing wood density, i.e. light-wooded species did not compensate for their lighter, weaker wood by substantially increasing stem thickness.


*
4
Mean growth rate per species showed a 10-fold range and increased with the fraction of trees at least partly in gaps (gap fraction), the reciprocal of support cost (1/Ms), and the reciprocal of wood density (1/$\rho$). The relationship between mean growth rate and 1/Ms was particularly strong when one outlier was excluded (r2 = 0.88) and among the Dipterocarpaceae (r2 = 0.89).


*
5
Log(mortality rate), as determined for all trees per species ≥ 1 cm d.b.h., increased linearly with 1/Ms, 1/$\rho$ and gap fraction.


*
6
These results suggest an important role for wood density and support costs in the classic tradeoff between rapid growth and increased risks of damage and death.},

abstract = {Community ecologists are active in describing species by their functional traits, quantifying the functional structure of plant and animal assemblages and inferring community assembly processes with null-model analyses of trait distribution and functional diversity indices. Intraspecific variation in traits and effects of spatial scale are potentially important in these analyses. Here, we introduce the R package cati (Community Assembly by Traits: Individuals and beyond) available on CRAN, for the analysis of community assembly with functional traits. cati builds on a recent approach to community assembly that explicitly incorporates individual differences in community assembly analyses and decomposes phenotypic variations across scales and organizational levels, based on three phenotypic variance ratios, termed the T-statistics. More generally, the cati package 1) calculates a variety of single-trait and multi-trait indices from interspecific and intraspecific trait measures; 2) it partitions functional trait variation among spatial and taxonomic levels; 3) it implements a palette of flexible null models for detecting non-random patterns of functional traits. These patterns can be used to draw inferences about hypotheses of community assembly such as environmental filtering and species interactions. The basic input for cati is a data frame in which columns are traits, rows are species or individuals, and entries are the measured trait values. The cati package can also incorporate a square distance matrix into analyses, which could include phylogenetic or genetic distances among individuals or species. Users select from a variety of functional trait metrics and analyze these relative to a null model that specifies trait distributions in a regional source pool.},

abstract = {A key element of most recently proposed plant strategy schemes is an axis of resource capture, usage and availability. In the search for a simple, robust plant trait (or traits) that will allow plants to be located on this axis, specific leaf area is one of the leading contenders. Using a large new unpublished database, we examine the variability of specific leaf area and other leaf traits, the relationships between them, and their ability to predict position on the resource use axis. Specific leaf area is found to suffer from a number of drawbacks; it is both very variable between replicates and much influenced by leaf thickness. Leaf dry-matter content (sometimes referred to as tissue density) is much less variable, largely independent of leaf thickness and a better predictor of location on an axis of resource capture, usage and availability. However, it is not clear how useful dry matter content will be outside northwest Europe, and in particular in dry climates with many succulents.},

abstract = {Accelerating rates of species extinction have prompted a growing number of researchers to manipulate the richness of various groups of organisms and examine how this aspect of diversity impacts ecological processes that control the functioning of ecosystems. We summarize the results of 44 experiments that have manipulated the richness of plants to examine how plant diversity affects the production of biomass. We show that mixtures of species produce an average of 1.7 times more biomass than species monocultures and are more productive than the average monoculture in 79{\%} of all experiments. However, in only 12{\%} of all experiments do diverse polycultures achieve greater biomass than their single most productive species. Previously, a positive net effect of diversity that is no greater than the most productive species has been interpreted as evidence for selection effects, which occur when diversity maximizes the chance that highly productive species will be included in and ultimately dominate the biomass of polycultures. Contrary to this, we show that although productive species do indeed contribute to diversity effects, these contributions are equaled or exceeded by species complementarity, where biomass is augmented by biological processes that involve multiple species. Importantly, both the net effect of diversity and the probability of polycultures being more productive than their most productive species increases through time, because the magnitude of complementarity increases as experiments are run longer. Our results suggest that experiments to date have, if anything, underestimated the impacts of species extinction on the productivity of ecosystems.},

abstract = {*
The leaf economics spectrum (LES) provides a useful framework for examining species strategies as shaped by their evolutionary history. However, that spectrum, as originally described, involved only two key resources (carbon and nutrients) and one of three economically important plant organs. Herein, I evaluate whether the economics spectrum idea can be broadly extended to water – the third key resource –stems, roots and entire plants and to individual, community and ecosystem scales. My overarching hypothesis is that strong selection along trait trade-off axes, in tandem with biophysical constraints, results in convergence for any taxon on a uniformly fast, medium or slow strategy (i.e. rates of resource acquisition and processing) for all organs and all resources.



*
Evidence for economic trait spectra exists for stems and roots as well as leaves, and for traits related to water as well as carbon and nutrients. These apply generally within and across scales (within and across communities, climate zones, biomes and lineages).



*
There are linkages across organs and coupling among resources, resulting in an integrated whole-plant economics spectrum. Species capable of moving water rapidly have low tissue density, short tissue life span and high rates of resource acquisition and flux at organ and individual scales. The reverse is true for species with the slow strategy. Different traits may be important in different conditions, but as being fast in one respect generally requires being fast in others, being fast or slow is a general feature of species.



*
Economic traits influence performance and fitness consistent with trait-based theory about underlying adaptive mechanisms. Traits help explain differences in growth and survival across resource gradients and thus help explain the distribution of species and the assembly of communities across light, water and nutrient gradients. Traits scale up – fast traits are associated with faster rates of ecosystem processes such as decomposition or primary productivity, and slow traits with slow process rates.



*
Synthesis. Traits matter. A single ‘fast–slow' plant economics spectrum that integrates across leaves, stems and roots is a key feature of the plant universe and helps to explain individual ecological strategies, community assembly processes and the functioning of ecosystems.},

abstract = {Abstract Leaf longevity and leaf turnover rate are important plant traits relating to plant growth, leaf photosynthesis and respiration, plant canopy dynamic and many other factors, but dynamic global vegetation models only set inaccurate values for these factors. In this study, we firstly investigated the leaf longevities at major vegetation types based on 418 field measurements from around the world. By replacing the default leaf longevities in the Lund-Potsdam-Jena model (LPJ) with the revised values, we examined the changes in simulated carbon cycle caused by the revised parameters. The results suggested that the compiled observations of leaf longevity were significantly different from the default values in LPJ. Both the vegetation production and respiration of the simulated natural ecosystems showed significant changes based on the revised leaf longevity compared with the predictions developed using default model parameters. Of all of the variables, the aboveground and belowground litter pools showed the largest changes (about 10{\%} globally). Globally, the default parameters induced a significant overestimation of terrestrial carbon sink by 3{\%}, compared with a simulation using the revised parameters. Furthermore, the uncertainties in leaf longevity caused various uncertainties (5–30{\%}) in the simulated carbon fluxes and carbon pools. The offset of biases in intermediate variables might result in rational final model outputs. Overall, more accurate leaf longevities are critical for simulating the vegetation distribution and ecosystem carbon cycle.},

abstract = {1. A fundamental trade-off among vascular plants between traits inferring rapid resource acquisition and those leading to conservation of resources has now been accepted broadly, but is based on empirical data with a strong bias towards leaf traits. Here, we test whether interspecific variation in traits of different plant organs obeys this same trade-off and whether within-plant trade-offs are consistent between organs. 2. Thereto, we measured suites of the same chemical and structural traits from the main vegetative organs for a species set representing aquatic, riparian and terrestrial environments including the main vascular higher taxa and growth forms of a subarctic flora. The traits were chosen to have consistent relevance for plant defence and growth across organs and environments: carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, lignin, dry matter content, pH. 3. Our analysis shows several new trait correlations across leaves, stems and roots and a striking pattern of whole-plant integrative resource economy, leading to tight correspondence between the local leaf economics spectrum and the root (r = 0.64), stem (r = 0.78) and whole-plant (r = 0.93) economics spectra. 4. Synthesis. Our findings strongly suggest that plant resource economics is consistent across species' organs in a subarctic flora. We provide thus the first evidence for a ‘plant economics spectrum' closely related to the local subarctic ‘leaf economics spectrum'. Extending that concept to other biomes is, however, necessary before any generalization might be made. In a world facing rapid vegetation change, these results nevertheless bear considerable prospects of predicting below-ground plant functions from the above-ground components alone.},

abstract = {Assessments of the long-term natural regeneration of tropical forests following selective logging are today mostly based on extrapolation of limited empirical observations. Mounting evidence suggests that current logging policies overestimate forest regrowth by a wide margin, and are therefore not sustainable. The need for more reliable assessment of natural forest growth dynamics has led to the development of a vertically and spatially structured dynamic simulation model of natural forest development. The model accounts explicitly for biomass and tree numbers in five distinct canopy layers (seedlings, saplings, poles, main canopy, emergents). Energy accounting of assimilation and dissimilation rates leads to biomass, diameter, and height growth in each layer. Leaf mass in each layer determines photoproduction, and light and photosynthesis conditions in lower layers. Transitions to higher layers, mortalities in each layer, and seed events are accounted for. The basic model simulates the development dynamics of a forest gap. Parallel computation of spatially distributed single gap models with stochastic mortalities and seed dispersal provides a simulation of the spatial dynamics of the tropical forest mosaic. Simulation results are provided with parameters corresponding to unlogged and logged Malaysian lowland dipterocarp forest. ?? 1991.},

@article{Porte2002,
abstract = {Most forests today are multi-specific and heterogeneous forests ('mixed forests'). However, forest modelling has been focusing on mono-specific stands for a long time, only recently have models been developed for mixed forests. Previous reviews of mixed forest modelling were restricted to certain categories of models only and were generally not considering application and suitability. The purpose of this paper is to give an overview of the models designed for or applied to modelling mixed forest growth and dynamics and to review the suitability of the different model types according to their intended purposes. The first part of the paper gives an overview of previous classifications, after which a new and overall classification scheme is presented. Next, the characteristics of the six modelling approaches that were distinguished are described: distance-dependent stand models, distribution models, average tree models, distance-dependent tree models, distance-independent tree models and gap models. All, except gap models, are close to mono-specific stands modelling approaches. The second part of the paper describes the main applications of these modelling approaches and presents a critical analysis of their suitability. Applications can be separated between growth and yield studies and forest dynamics simulation studies. Attention must be paid to recruitment sub-models, which appear to be inadequate in many models, but which highly influence the simulation outcome. All types of model were used as management tools. Stand level simulations fit the yield data better than tree level simulations, as a result of cumulated model errors from tree to stand level. However, tree level approaches seem most appropriate to understand stand growth as affected by competition between individuals of different species. Forest dynamics were mostly modelled using distribution models, gap models and distance-dependent tree models. The latter appeared to be less suitable because of the difficulties in modelling 3D stand structure over large periods and areas. Gap models could be applied to larger areas and time periods than distribution models, especially when they included detailed descriptions of the ecological functioning of the ecosystem. In sum the empirical models appeared more accurate in their predictions than mechanistic models, but they are highly dependent on the data used for parameterisation. That makes them unsuitable for extrapolation to other systems or conditions. Although mechanistic models can also be misused, adding mechanistic approaches to empirical observations is necessary to model the growth and dynamics of complex forest systems. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {The relationships between resource availabili- ty, plant succession, and species' life history traits are often considered key to understanding variation among species and communities. Leaf lifespan is one trait im- portant in this regard. We observed that leaf lifespan varies 30-fold among 23 species from natural and dis- turbed communities within a 1-km radius in the northern Amazon basin, near San Carlos de Rio Negro, Venezue- la. Moreover, leaf lifespan was highly correlated with a number of important leaf structural and functional characteristics. Stomatal conductance to water vapor (g) and both mass and area-based net photosynthesis de- creased with increasing leaf lifespan (r2 = 0.74, 0.91 and 0.75, respectively). Specific leaf area (SLA) also de- creased with increasing leaf lifespan (r2 = 0.78), while leaf toughness increased (r2 = 0.62). Correlations between leaf lifespan and leaf nitrogen and phosphorus concen- trations were moderate on a weight basis and not signifi- cant on an area basis. On an absolute basis, changes in SLA, net photosynthesis and leaf chemistry were large as leaf lifespan varied from 1.5 to 12 months, but such changes were small as leaf lifespan increased from 1 to 5 years. Mass-based net photosynthesis (A/mass) was highly correlated with SLA (r2 = 0.90) and mass-based leaf nitrogen (N/mass) (r2 = 0.85), but area-based net photosynthesis (A/area) was not well correlated with any index of leaf structure or chemistry including N/area. Overall, these results indicate that species allocate re- sources towards a high photosynthetic assimilation rate for a brief time, or provide resistant physical structure that results in a lower rate of carbon assimilation over a longer time, but not both.

abstract = {Vast expanses of tropical forests worldwide are being impacted by selective logging. We evaluate the environmental impacts of such logging and conclude that natural timber-production forests typically retain most of their biodiversity and associated ecosystem functions, as well as their carbon, climatic, and soil-hydrological ecosystem services. Unfortunately, the value of production forests is often overlooked, leaving them vulnerable to further degradation including post-logging clearing, fires, and hunting. Because logged tropical forests are extensive, functionally diverse, and provide many ecosystem services, efforts to expand their role in conservation strategies are urgently needed. Key priorities include improving harvest practices to reduce negative impacts on ecosystem functions and services, and preventing the rapid conversion and loss of logged forests. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Modelling strategies for predicting the potential impacts of climate change on the natural distribution of species have often focused on the characterization of a species' bioclimate envelope. A number of recent critiques have questioned the validity of this approach by pointing to the many factors other than climate that play an important part in determining species distributions and the dynamics of distribution changes. Such factors include biotic interactions, evolutionary change and dispersal ability. This paper reviews and evaluates criticisms of bioclimate envelope models and discusses the implications of these criticisms for the different modelling strategies employed. It is proposed that, although the complexity of the natural system presents fundamental limits to predictive modelling, the bioclimate envelope approach can provide a useful first approximation as to the potentially dramatic impact of climate change on biodiversity. However, it is stressed that the spatial scale at which these models are applied is of fundamental importance, and that model results should not be interpreted without due consideration of the limitations involved. A hierarchical modelling framework is proposed through which some of these limitations can be addressed within a broader, scale-dependent context.},

@article{hodgson_is_2011,
abstract = {Background and Aims Specific leaf area (SLA), a key element of the ‘worldwide leaf economics spectrum', is the preferred ‘soft' plant trait for assessing soil fertility. SLA is a function of leaf dry matter content (LDMC) and leaf thickness (LT). The first, LDMC, defines leaf construction costs and can be used instead of SLA. However, LT identifies shade at its lowest extreme and succulence at its highest, and is not related to soil fertility. Why then is SLA more frequently used as a predictor of soil fertility than LDMC?
Methods SLA, LDMC and LT were measured and leaf density (LD) estimated for almost 2000 species, and the capacity of LD to predict LDMC was examined, as was the relative contribution of LDMC and LT to the expression of SLA. Subsequently, the relationships between SLA, LDMC and LT with respect to soil fertility and shade were described.
Key Results Although LD is strongly related to LDMC, and LDMC and LT each contribute equally to the expression of SLA, the exact relationships differ between ecological groupings. LDMC predicts leaf nitrogen content and soil fertility but, because LT primarily varies with light intensity, SLA increases in response to both increased shade and increased fertility.
Conclusions Gradients of soil fertility are frequently also gradients of biomass accumulation with reduced irradiance lower in the canopy. Therefore, SLA, which includes both fertility and shade components, may often discriminate better between communities or treatments than LDMC. However, LDMC should always be the preferred trait for assessing gradients of soil fertility uncoupled from shade. Nevertheless, because leaves multitask, individual leaf traits do not necessarily exhibit exact functional equivalence between species. In consequence, rather than using a single stand-alone predictor, multivariate analyses using several leaf traits is recommended.},

Merging the two perspectives is necessary both to ensure continued scientific progress and to provide society with the scientific means to face growing environmental challenges. Recent research on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning has contributed to this goal in several ways. By addressing a new question of high relevance for both science and society, by challenging existing paradigms, by tightly linking theory and experiments, by building scientific consensus beyond differences in opinion, by integrating fragmented disciplines and research fields, by connecting itself to other disciplines and management issues, it has helped transform ecology not only in content, but also in form. Creating a genuine evolutionary ecosystem ecology that links the evolution of species traits at the individual level, the dynamics of species interactions, and the overall functioning of ecosystems would give new impetus to this much-needed process of unification across ecological disciplines. Recent community evolution models are a promising step in that direction.},

abstract = {Individual-based forest models simulate forest dynamics on the basis of establishment, growth and death of individual trees. This paper attempts to review and compare two major types of individual-based forest models: growth-yield and gap models. Although the two types of models share some similar features, they differ in model structure and data requirements and play several complementary roles. Growth-yield models are used by foresters to assist timber production and evaluate growth and yield of one to several commercial timber species in managed forests, while gap models are generally developed by ecologists to explore ecological mechanisms and patterns of structure and functional dynamics in natural forest ecosystems. Site-specific environmental and species information is necessary for constructing growth-yield models while gap models require species-specific biological infomation of individual trees and site-specific environmental data. The growth-yield models are more diverse in terms of model structure. In contrast, gap models belong to the same genealogy and later gap models are ultimately derived from the earliest one although they may vary in detail. In the future, we expect to see more individual-ased hybrid models which integrate gap models with growth-yield models and ecophysiological models. As computer technology advances explosively, individual-based models could be much more efficient and user-friendly. There have existed disproportionately few individual-based models for biodiverse forests such as evergreen tropical rain forests. Development of individual-based models for tropical rain forests is more challenging and is being stimulated by new international conservation efforts.},

abstract = {Current circumstances — that the majority of species distribution records exist as presence-only data (e.g. from museums and herbaria), and that there is an established need for predictions of species distributions — mean that scientists and conservation managers seek to develop robust methods for using these data. Such methods must, in particular, accommodate the difficulties caused by lack of reliable information about sites where species are absent. Here we test two approaches for overcoming these difficulties, analysing a range of data sets using the technique of multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS). MARS is closely related to regression techniques such as generalized additive models (GAMs) that are commonly and successfully used in modelling species distributions, but has particular advantages in its analytical speed and the ease of transfer of analysis results to other computational environments such as a Geographic Information System. MARS also has the advantage that it can model multiple responses, meaning that it can combine information from a set of species to determine the dominant environmental drivers of variation in species composition. We use data from 226 species from six regions of the world, and demonstrate the use of MARS for distribution modelling using presence-only data. We test whether (1) the type of data used to represent absence or background and (2) the signal from multiple species affect predictive performance, by evaluating predictions at completely independent sites where genuine presence–absence data were recorded. Models developed with absences inferred from the total set of presence-only sites for a biological group, and using simultaneous analysis of multiple species to inform the choice of predictor variables, performed better than models in which species were analysed singly, or in which pseudo-absences were drawn randomly from the study area. The methods are fast, relatively simple to understand, and useful for situations where data are limited. A tutorial is included.},

The rainfall data relate to the south-west monsoon season June to September (122 days), which accounts for the major part of the annual rainfall over most parts of the country. For each of the stations the rain-days are arranged in ascending order of rain amount, and the association between the cumulated percentage rain amount (x) and the cumulated percentage number of rain-days (y), designated as the normalized rainfall curve (NRC), is calculated. It has been shown in an earlier study that x and y are related by the equation x = y exp [— b(100—y)c], where b and c are empirical constants that depend on the coefficient of variation (CV) of the rainfall series. This equation has been utilized to study various parameters of the daily rainfall distribution. The coefficient of variation of the daily rainfall series varies between 100 per cent and 230 per cent at individual stations, with nearly half the number of stations having CV values in the range 130–150 per cent. The number of days of significant rainfall (days with rainfall greater than the mean intensity per rain-day) constitute about 30 per cent of the total number of rain-days and account for about 75 per cent of the seasonal rainfall at almost all the stations.},

Abstract
Functional and phylogenetic diversity are increasingly quantified in various fields of ecology and conservation biology. The need to maintain diversity turnover among sites, so-called beta-diversity, has also been raised in theoretical and applied ecology. In this study, we propose the first comprehensive framework for the large-scale mapping of taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional diversity and of their respective turnover. Using high-resolution data on the spatial distribution and abundance of birds at a country scale, we disentangled areas of mismatches and congruencies between biodiversity components. We further revealed unequal representation of each component in protected areas: functional diversity was significantly under-represented whereas taxonomic diversity was significantly over-represented in protected areas. Our results challenge the use of any one diversity component as a surrogate for other components and stress the need to adopt an integrative approach to biodiversity conservation.},

@article{hardy_testing_2008,
abstract = {* 1Analyzing the phylogenetic structure of natural communities may illuminate the processes governing the assembly and coexistence of species. For instance, an association between species co-occurrence in local communities and their phylogenetic proximity may reveal the action of habitat filtering, niche conservatism and/or competitive exclusion.
* 2Different methods were recently proposed to test such community-wide phylogenetic patterns, based on the phylogenetic clustering or overdispersion of the species in a local community. This provides a much needed framework for addressing long standing questions in community ecology as well as the recent debate on community neutrality. The testing procedures are based on (i) a metric measuring the association between phylogenetic distance and species co-occurrence, and (ii) a data set randomization algorithm providing the distribution of the metric under a given ‘null model'. However, the statistical properties of these approaches are not well-established and their reliability must be tested against simulated data sets.
* 3This paper reviews metrics and null models used in previous studies. A ‘locally neutral' subdivided community model is simulated to produce data sets devoid of phylogenetic structure in the spatial distribution of species. Using these data sets, the consistency of Type I error rates of tests based on 10 metrics combined with nine null models is examined.
* 4This study shows that most tests can become liberal (i.e. tests rejecting too often the null hypothesis that only neutral processes structured spatially the local community) when the randomization algorithm breaks down a structure in the original data set unrelated to the null hypothesis to test. Hence, when overall species abundances are distributed non-randomly across the phylogeny or when local abundances are spatially autocorrelated, better statistical performances were achieved by randomization algorithms preserving these structural features. The most reliable randomization algorithm consists of permuting species with similar abundances among the tips of the phylogenetic tree. One metric, RPD-DO, also proved to be robust under most simulated conditions using a variety of null models.
* 5Synthesis. Given the suboptimal performances of several tests, attention must be paid to the testing procedures used in future studies. Guidelines are provided to help choosing an adequate test.},

abstract = {The world's greatest terrestrial stores of biodiversity and carbon are found in the forests of northern South America, where large-scale biogeographic patterns and processes have recently begun to be described. Seven of the nine countries with territory in the Amazon basin and the Guiana shield have carried out large-scale forest inventories, but such massive data sets have been little exploited by tropical plant ecologists. Although forest inventories often lack the species-level identifications favoured by tropical plant ecologists, their consistency of measurement and vast spatial coverage make them ideally suited for numerical analyses at large scales, and a valuable resource to describe the still poorly understood spatial variation of biomass, diversity, community composition and forest functioning across the South American tropics. Here we show, by using the seven forest inventories complemented with trait and inventory data collected elsewhere, two dominant gradients in tree composition and function across the Amazon, one paralleling a major gradient in soil fertility and the other paralleling a gradient in dry season length. The data set also indicates that the dominance of Fabaceae in the Guiana shield is not necessarily the result of root adaptations to poor soils (nodulation or ectomycorrhizal associations) but perhaps also the result of their remarkably high seed mass there as a potential adaptation to low rates of disturbance.},

@article{Goldstein2016,
abstract = {Leaf lifespan, the time from leaf expansion to shedding, exhibits wide variation and is a key integrator of relationships with photosynthetic rate, leaf mass per area (LMA), and leaf nitrogen among coexisting tropical tree species. We present a hierarchical view of sources of variation in leaf lifespan in tropical forests, emphasizing the importance of substantial within-species variation, which has rarely been addressed. Interspecific variation in leaf lifespan is positively correlated with LMA, varying from short-lived, low-LMA leaves to long-lived, high-LMA leaves of species associated with resource-rich versus resource-depleted habitats, respectively. Phenotypic responses of leaf lifespan and LMA to light show counter-gradient variation: with acclimation to shade, leaf lifespan increases, and LMA decreases, but both increase with adaptation to shade. In contrast, phenotypic responses to soil fertility are predicted to show co-gradient variation: both leaf lifespan and LMA increase with declining fertility both inter- and intraspecifically. We present new data analyses supporting these predictions, but the interactive effects of light and soil resources can produce complex phenotypic responses. Future studies of leaf lifespan should devote more attention to within-species variation to better quantify and explain how leaf lifespan is central to trade-offs generating the contrasting ecological strategies of tropical tree species.

abstract = {The high alpha-diversity of tropical forests has been amply documented, but beta-diversity—how species composition changes with distance—has seldom been studied. We present quantitative estimates of beta-diversity for tropical trees by comparing species composition of plots in lowland terra firme forest in Panama, Ecuador, and Peru. We compare observations with predictions derived from a neutral model in which habitat is uniform and only dispersal and speciation influence species turnover. We find that beta-diversity is higher in Panama than in western Amazonia and that patterns in both areas are inconsistent with the neutral model. In Panama, habitat variation appears to increase species turnover relative to Amazonia, where unexpectedly low turnover over great distances suggests that population densities of some species are bounded by as yet unidentified processes. At intermediate scales in both regions, observations can be matched by theory, suggesting that dispersal limitation, with speciation, influences species turnover.},

@article{violle_let_2007,
abstract = {In its simplest definition, a trait is a surrogate of organismal performance, and this meaning of the term has been used by evolutionists for a long time. Over the last three decades, developments in community and ecosystem ecology have forced the concept of trait beyond these original boundaries, and trait-based approaches are now widely used in studies ranging from the level of organisms to that of ecosystems. Despite some attempts to fix the terminology, especially in plant ecology, there is currently a high degree of confusion in the use, not only of the term “trait” itself, but also in the underlying concepts it refers to. We therefore give an unambiguous definition of plant trait, with a particular emphasis on functional trait. A hierarchical perspective is proposed, extending the “performance paradigm” to plant ecology. “Functional traits” are defined as morpho-physio-phenological traits which impact fitness indirectly via their effects on growth, reproduction and survival, the three components of individual performance. We finally present an integrative framework explaining how changes in trait values due to environmental variations are translated into organismal performance, and how these changes may influence processes at higher organizational levels. We argue that this can be achieved by developing “integration functions” which can be grouped into functional response (community level) and effect (ecosystem level) algorithms.},

abstract = {Aim Spatial modelling techniques are increasingly used in species distribution modelling. However, the implemented techniques differ in their modelling performance, and some consensus methods are needed to reduce the uncertainty of predictions. In this study, we tested the predictive accuracies of five consensus methods, namely Weighted Average (WA), Mean(All), Median(All), Median(PCA), and Best, for 28 threatened plant species. Location North-eastern Finland, Europe. Methods The spatial distributions of the plant species were forecasted using eight state-of-the-art single-modelling techniques providing an ensemble of predictions. The probability values of occurrence were then combined using five consensus algorithms. The predictive accuracies of the single-model and consensus methods were assessed by computing the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver-operating characteristic plot. Results The mean AUC values varied between 0.697 (classification tree analysis) and 0.813 (random forest) for the single-models, and from 0.757 to 0.850 for the consensus methods. WA and Mean(All) consensus methods provided significantly more robust predictions than all the single-models and the other consensus methods. Main conclusions Consensus methods based on average function algorithms may increase significantly the accuracy of species distribution forecasts, and thus they show considerable promise for different conservation biological and biogeographical applications.},

abstract = {The paradox of biodiversity involves three elements, (i) mathematical models predict that species must differ in specific ways in order to coexist as stable ecological communities, (ii) such differences are difficult to identify, yet (iii) there is widespread evidence of stability in natural communities. Debate has centred on two views. The first explanation involves tradeoffs along a small number of axes, including 'colonization-competition', resource competition (light, water, nitrogen for plants, including the 'successional niche'), and life history (e.g. high-light growth vs. low-light survival and few large vs. many small seeds). The second view is neutrality, which assumes that species differences do not contribute to dynamics. Clark et al. (2004) presented a third explanation, that coexistence is inherently high dimensional, but still depends on species differences. We demonstrate that neither traditional low-dimensional tradeoffs nor neutrality can resolve the biodiversity paradox, in part by showing that they do not properly interpret stochasticity in statistical and in theoretical models. Unless sample sizes are small, traditional data modelling assures that species will appear different in a few dimensions, but those differences will rarely predict coexistence when parameter estimates are plugged into theoretical models. Contrary to standard interpretations, neutral models do not imply functional equivalence, but rather subsume species differences in stochastic terms. New hierarchical modelling techniques for inference reveal high-dimensional differences among species that can be quantified with random individual and temporal effects (RITES), i.e. process-level variation that results from many causes. We show that this variation is large, and that it stands in for species differences along unobserved dimensions that do contribute to diversity. High dimensional coexistence contrasts with the classical notions of tradeoffs along a few axes, which are often not found in data, and with 'neutral models', which mask, rather than eliminate, tradeoffs in stochastic terms. This mechanism can explain coexistence of species that would not occur with simple, low-dimensional tradeoff scenarios.},

abstract = {Fisher's linear discriminant analysis is a valuable tool for multigroup classification. With a large number of predictors, one can find a reduced number of discriminant coordinate functions that are “optimal” for separating the groups. With two such functions, one can produce a classification map that partitions the reduced space into regions that are identified with group membership, and the decision boundaries are linear. This article is about richer nonlinear classification schemes. Linear discriminant analysis is equivalent to multiresponse linear regression using optimal scorings to represent the groups. In this paper, we obtain nonparametric versions of discriminant analysis by replacing linear regression by any nonparametric regression method. In this way, any multiresponse regression technique (such as MARS or neural networks) can be postprocessed to improve its classification performance.},

abstract = {Understanding the processes maintaining species diversity is a central problem in ecology, with implications for the conservation and management of ecosystems. Although biologists often assume that trait differences between competitors promote diversity, empirical evidence connecting functional traits to the niche differences that stabilize species coexistence is rare. Obtaining such evidence is critical because traits also underlie the average fitness differences driving competitive exclusion, and this complicates efforts to infer community dynamics from phenotypic patterns. We coupled field-parameterized mathematical models of competition between 102 pairs of annual plants with detailed sampling of leaf, seed, root, and whole-plant functional traits to relate phenotypic differences to stabilizing niche and average fitness differences. Single functional traits were often well correlated with average fitness differences between species, indicating that competitive dominance was associated with late phenology, deep rooting, and several other traits. In contrast, single functional traits were poorly correlated with the stabilizing niche differences that promote coexistence. Niche differences could only be described by combinations of traits, corresponding to differentiation between species in multiple ecological dimensions. In addition, several traits were associated with both fitness differences and stabilizing niche differences. These complex relationships between phenotypic differences and the dynamics of competing species argue against the simple use of single functional traits to infer community assembly processes but lay the groundwork for a theoretically justified trait-based community ecology.},

abstract = {Convergence in interspecific leaf trait relationships across diverse taxonomic groups and biomes would have important evolutionary and ecological implications. Such convergence has been hypothesized to result from trade-offs that limit the combination of plant traits for any species. Here we address this issue by testing for biome differences in the slope and intercept of interspecific relationships among leaf traits: longevity, net photosynthetic capacity (A(max)), leaf diffusive conductance (G(s)), specific leaf area (SLA), and nitrogen (N) status, for more than 100 species in six distinct biomes of the Americas. The six biomes were: alpine tundra-subalpine forest ecotone, cold temperate forest-prairie ecotone, montane cool temperate forest, desert shrubland, subtropical forest, and tropical rain forest. Despite large differences in climate and evolutionary history, in all biomes mass-based leaf N (N(mass)), SLA, G(s), and A(max) were positively related to one another and decreased with increasing leaf life span. The relationships between pairs of leaf traits exhibited similar slopes among biomes, suggesting a predictable set of scaling relationships among key leaf morphological, chemical, and metabolic traits that are replicated globally among terrestrial ecosystems regardless of biome or vegetation type. However, the intercept (i.e., the overall elevation of regression lines) of relationships between pairs of leaf traits usually differed among biomes. With increasing aridity across sites, species had greater Amax for a given level of G(s) and lower SLA for any given leaf life span. Using principal components analysis, most variation among species was explained by an axis related to mass-based leaf traits (A(max), N, and SLA) while a second axis reflected climate, G(s), and other area-based leaf traits.},

abstract = {Timber production is an important economic sector in most forested countries of Central Africa, where about 14 million hectares of lowland moist forests are now planned for management. This production is expected to be sustainable, but the actual impact of logging on biodiversity is still questioned.To answer this question, we used a unique long-term controlled experiment implemented more than 20. years ago in an old-growth semi-deciduous moist forest of the Central African Republic (CAR). We tested whether (i) anthropogenic disturbances associated with silvicultural operations had an effect on the composition and diversity of tree communities, and (ii) there is a relationship between diversity and disturbance intensity in those forests.For this, we botanically identified all trees. ≥. 10. cm DBH in 28 1-ha plots where no treatment (controls), logging and logging. +. thinning operations were implemented 24. years ago and created a strong gradient of disturbance. We investigated the relationships between five diversity indices and a disturbance index calculated for each 1-ha plot, for all species and separately for three regeneration guilds.We found a strong positive monotonic relationship between the intensity of disturbance and the percentage of pioneer species in the tree communities, which proved to be equally detrimental, in terms of relative abundance, to the non-pioneer light-demanding and the shade-bearing species.Overall, disturbance appeared to have a weak monotonous negative effect on diversity, irrespective to the index considered. The diversity of shade-bearers slightly decreased along the disturbance gradient without significant decrease in species density; disturbance had no effect on non-pioneer light demanders, but a clear significant negative effect on the diversity of pioneers, with a significant decrease in species density. This negative effect was associated with the massive recruitment of the early-successional, fast-growing Musanga cecropioides R. Br. (Urticaceae), which rapidly preempted space and resources in the most disturbed plots. Despite this effect, disturbance did not significantly affect the local heterogeneity in species distribution.These results suggest that the semi-deciduous moist forests of CAR are locally resilient to small-scale disturbances associated with silvicultural operations. This may be a consequence of the past anthropogenic and/or climatic disturbances, which have been stronger and more long-lasting than elsewhere within the tropical forest biome, and would have removed the most vulnerable species. Because logging intensity in these forests is usually low, we do not expect any direct major impact on tree species diversity, at least after the first felling cycle. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {▪ Abstract The focus of most ideas on diversity maintenance is species coexistence, which may be stable or unstable. Stable coexistence can be quantified by the long-term rates at which community members recover from low density. Quantification shows that coexistence mechanisms function in two major ways: They may be (a) equalizing because they tend to minimize average fitness differences between species, or (b) stabilizing because they tend to increase negative intraspecific interactions relative to negative interspecific interactions. Stabilizing mechanisms are essential for species coexistence and include traditional mechanisms such as resource partitioning and frequency-dependent predation, as well as mechanisms that depend on fluctuations in population densities and environmental factors in space and time. Equalizing mechanisms contribute to stable coexistence because they reduce large average fitness inequalities which might negate the effects of stabilizing mechanisms.

abstract = {Abstract: Mechanisms proposed to explain the maintenance of species diversity within ecological communities of sessile organisms include niche differentiation mediated by competitive trade‐offs, frequency dependence resulting from species‐specific pests, recruitment limitation due to local dispersal, and a speciation‐extinction dynamic equilibrium mediated by stochasticity (drift). While each of these processes, and more, have been shown to act in particular communities, much remains to be learned about their relative importance in shaping community‐level patterns. We used a spatially‐explicit, individual‐based model to assess the effects of each of these processes on species richness, relative abundance, and spatial patterns such as the species‐area curve. Our model communities had an order‐of‐magnitude more individuals than any previous such study, and we also developed a finite‐size scaling analysis to infer the large‐scale properties of these systems in order to establish the generality of our conclusions across system sizes. As expected, each mechanism can promote diversity. We found some qualitative differences in community patterns across communities in which different combinations of these mechanisms operate. Species‐area curves follow a power law with short‐range dispersal and a logarithmic law with global dispersal. Relative‐abundance distributions are more even for systems with competitive differences and trade‐offs than for those in which all species are competitively equivalent, and they are most even when frequency dependence (even if weak) is present. Overall, however, communities in which different processes operated showed surprisingly similar patterns, which suggests that the form of community‐level patterns cannot in general be used to distinguish among mechanisms maintaining diversity there. Nevertheless, parameterization of models such as these from field data on the strengths of the different mechanisms could yield insight into their relative roles in diversity maintenance in any given community.},

All traits were measured in a series of pot experiments, and leaf traits additionally in the field.

abstract = {I review the mathematical and biological aspects of Hubbell's (2001) neutral theory of species abundance for ecological communities, and clarify its historical connections with closely related approaches in population genetics. A selective overview of the empirical evidence for and against this theory is provided, with a special emphasis on tropical plant communities. The neutral theory predicts many of the basic patterns of biodiversity, confirming its heuristic power. The strict assumption of equivalence that defines neutrality, equivalence among individuals, finds little empirical support in general. However, a weaker assumption holds for stable communities, the equivalence of average fitness among species. One reason for the surprising success of the neutral theory is that all the theories of species coexistence satisfying the fitness equivalence assumption, including many theories of niche differentiation, generate exactly the same patterns as the neutral theory. Hubbell's neutral theory represents an important synthesis and a much needed demonstration of the pivotal role of intraspecific variability in ecology. Further improvements should lead to an explicit linking to niche-based processes. This research programme will depend crucially on forthcoming theoretical and empirical achievements.},

abstract = {Practitioners and decision-makers need information on how to conserve mixed Fir and Spruce forests in mountains. To answer this question, we modelled demographic (growth, mortality, recruitment) and allometric functions from field data for the two species. These functions have been implemented in a forest dynamics model to improve the knowledge on natural dynamics of the two species and to test for silvicultural practices. Parameter estimation was performed within a hierarchical Bayesian framework. Estimation permitted to quantify and underline species differences : Fir, the relatively shade-tolerant species compared to Spruce, was less sensitive to self-thinning, had a higher growth and a higher probability of recruitment at low light than Spruce. Models took into account observation errors and spatio-temporal process variability. Individual variability (or so-called intra-specific variability) and temporal variability (interannual and intraindividual variability) were significant and tended to equalize species fitness, inverting species hierarchy locally in space or sporadically in time. First simulations with simulator Samsara2 showed a better behavior of the model when including process variability. Variability led to patterns for stand structuration (tree heights and diameters) and to patterns for basal-area evolution with time which were much more realistic than without variability. Running simulations on a mixed Fir and Spruce stand, we observed a competitive exclusion of Spruce by Fir. Equalizing mechanisms associated to variability were not able to blur the competitive advantage of Fir on Spruce. Nevertheless, transient dynamics of the system was slow and apparent coexistence of the two species lasted for several hundred years.},

We extend these tissue-specific analyses of functional strategy towards a whole-plant approach by integrating data on functional traits for 13 448 leaves and wood tissues from 4672 trees representing 668 species of Neotropical trees. Strong correlations amongst traits previously defined as the leaf economics spectrum reflect a tradeoff between investments in productive leaves with rapid turnover vs. costly physical leaf structure with a long revenue stream. A second axis of variation, the ‘stem economics spectrum', defines a similar tradeoff at the stem level: dense wood vs. high wood water content and thick bark. Most importantly, these two axes are orthogonal, suggesting that tradeoffs operate independently at the leaf and at the stem levels. By simplifying the multivariate ecological strategies of tropical trees into positions along these two spectra, our results provide a basis to improve global vegetation models predicting responses of tropical forests to global change.},

@article{Loreau2000,
abstract = {The relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning has emerged as a major scientific issue today. As experiments progress, there is a growing need for adequate theories and models to provide robust interpretations and generalisations of experimental results, and to formulate new hypotheses. This paper provides an overview of recent theoretical advances that have been made on the two major questions in this area: (1) How does biodiversity affect the magnitude of ecosystem processes (short-term effects of biodiversity)? (2) How does biodiversity contribute to the stability and maintenance of ecosystem processes in the face of perturbations (long-term effects of biodiversity)? Positive short-term effects of species diversity on ecosystem processes, such as primary productivity and nutrient retention, have been explained by two major types of mechanisms: (1) functional niche complementarity (the complementarity effect), and (2) selection of extreme trait values (the selection effect). In both cases, biodiversity provides a range of phenotypic trait variation. In the complementarity effect, trait variation then forms the basis for a permanent association of species that enhances collective performance. In the selection effect, trait variation comes into play only as an initial condition, and a selective process then promotes dominance by species with extreme trait values. Major differences between within-site effects of biodiversity and across-site productivity-diversity patterns have also been clarified. The local effects of diversity on ecosystem processes are expected to be masked by the effects of varying environmental parameters in across-site comparisons. A major reappraisal of the paradigm that has dominated during the last decades seems necessary if we are to account for long-term effects of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning. The classical deterministic, equilibrium approaches to stability do not explain the reduced temporal variability of aggregate ecosystem properties that has been observed in more diverse systems. On the other hand, stochastic, nonequilibrium approaches do show two types of biodiversity effects on ecosystem productivity in a fluctuating environment: (1) a buffering effect, i.e., a reduction in the temporal variance; and (2) a performance-enhancing effect, i.e., an increase in the temporal mean. The basic mechanisms involved in these long-term insurance effects are very similar to those that operate in short-term biodiversity effects: temporal niche complementarity, and selection of extreme trait values. The ability of species diversity to provide an insurance against environmental fluctuations and a reservoir of variation allowing adaptation to changing conditions may be critical in a long-term perspective. These recent theoretical developments in the area of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning suggest that linking community and ecosystem ecology is a fruitful avenue, which paves the way for a new ecological synthesis.},

@article{Bose2015,
abstract = {Multi-cohort-based forest management has been proposed as a strategy to conciliate wood supply and biodiversity conservation objectives. At the stand-level, the approach involves using partial harvesting to generate structurally complex stands, notably in terms of tree age, size and species mixtures, conditions that are not easily integrated into yield tables. Using SORTIE-ND, a spatially explicit stand dynamics model, we simulated 100-year development patterns following different partial harvesting treatments in two trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx)-dominated stands in eastern Canada, one 76-year old (pure aspen) and the other 90 years old (mixed aspen). The two stand types differed primarily in the nature of their understory: pure aspen stands had little advance conifer growth and a dense understory of a woody shrub species whereas mixed aspen stands were characterized by a dense regeneration layer of shade-tolerant conifers. To do this, we first evaluated model performance using short (12 years) and long (168 years) term empirical data. We then modelled stand dynamics following a range of simulated partial harvesting treatments of different intensities (33, 61 and 80{\%} basal area removal), and gap sizes (400, 900 and 1600m2). Following mortality of the first cohort of aspen, simulations projected dominance of conifer species, white spruce in particular, in unharvested controls of pure aspen stands and balsam fir in mixed aspen stands. Aspen recruitment increased with intensity of partial harvesting. All gap treatments and the 80{\%} dispersed harvesting favored recruitment of aspen over conifer species. After 100-year simulation runs, the 1600m2 gap treatment resulted in highest stand basal areas, 38.0 and 34.1m2ha−1, of which 18{\%} and 28{\%} consisted of intermediate- to shade-tolerant conifer species in pure aspen stands and in mixed aspen stands, respectively. Concerns surrounding partial harvesting have tended to focus on absolute retention levels and standing residence times of trees; however, our results demonstrate that both stand structure and timber production rates are influenced not only by retention levels after partial harvesting but also by spatial configuration of the residual trees. We identified several model functions that are likely responsible for divergences between empirical conditions and those simulated by SORTIE-ND for the boreal mixedwood and suggest specific empirical studies to improve parameter functions of this modelling tool.},

abstract = {Not a single tree species distribution in the Amazon basin has been reliably mapped, though speculation regarding such distributions has been extensive. We present data from a network of 21 forest plots in Manu National Park, Peru, totaling {\textgreater}36 ha and sited over an area of ∼400 km2, to explore how tree species are distributed across upper Amazonia at a variety of spatial scales. For each of 825 tree species occurring in the plots we asked three questions: (1) Does the species have a large or small geographic range? (2) Is the species restricted to a single forest type, or is it found in several? (3) Is the species locally abundant anywhere or is it scarce everywhere? The answers served to classify a subset of species under Rabinowitz's classification scheme for rare species. Three main conclusions emerged. First, the great majority of tree species at Manu are geographically widespread. Every species identified to date occurs elsewhere in South America, outside the department of Madre de Dios; more than two-thirds of them have been collected 1500 km away in Amazonian Ecuador. Second, 15–26{\%} of species appear to be restricted to a single forest type, when forest types are defined by historical river dynamics (i.e., terra firme forest, mature floodplain forest, swamp forest, and primary successional floodplain forest). The proportion of restricted species declined with increasing sampling effort, making 15{\%} a more reliable figure. Third, while 88{\%} of species occurred at densities of {\textless}1 individual/ha over the entire network of plots, at least half occurred somewhere at densities of {\textgreater}1.5 individuals/ha. Extrapolating these results provides a first guess at how tree species are distributed across the western portion of the Amazon basin. We conclude with the suggestion that most tree species in the region are habitat generalists occurring over large areas of the Amazonian lowlands at low densities but large absolute population sizes.},

abstract = {A sequence of red through yellow to grey soils from well drained hilltops to poorly drained valleys is common on the backslopes of the Western Ghaˆts, Southern India. Detailed field observations along a representative toposequence developed from weathered schists, and local petrographic, mineralogical and chemical investigations are used to (i) link yellow, white and brown features to yellowing, bleaching and ferritisation processes, and (ii) relate the enlargement of these features and the development of these processes to aquic and drainage conditions. Precise demarcation of soil morphological features at toposequence scale permits to differentiate an upslope ferralitic domain from a dowslope hydromorphic domain. In each of these domains, geometrical relationships expressed in terms of either concordance or discordance between horizon and colour boundaries are taken as arguments to point out that aquic conditions have expanded upslope in the landscape at some time in the past. As a consequence partial and selective dissolution of iron oxides resulted in yellowing of reddish soil material. Dissolution which affected first hematite then gcethite was controlled by Al substitution in the crystal structure of iron oxides. It has been reproduced in the laboratory using a chemical reducing agent. Yellowing is associated with the onset of aquic conditions: yellow colours occur predominantly at the periphery of the hydromorphic domain. In the hydromorphic domain, complete removal of iron oxides similarly resulted in bleaching of yellow materials and was linked to waterlogging. Iron mobilized by yellowing and bleaching processes moved along established flow paths, and locally crystallized and concentrated in saprolite by ferritisation. Bleaching and ferritisation occurred downslope and downward into the soil to form the inner white-brown zone of the hydromorphic domain. The amount of iron stored in low lying positions and the development of weakly weathering conditions suggest that the internal drainage of the ground watertables was limited. This study cannot conclude if yellowing, bleaching and ferritisation are still actively occurring, as no hydo-geochemical investigations were conducted along the toposequence.},

abstract = {The maintenance in the long run of a positive carbon balance under very low irradiance is a prerequisite for survival of tree seedlings below the canopy or in small gaps in a tropical rainforest. To provide a quantitative basis for this assumption, experiments were carried out to determine whether construction cost (CC) and payback time for leaves and support structures, as well as leaf life span (i) differ among species and (ii) display an irradiance-elicited plasticity. Experiments were also conducted to determine whether leaf life span correlates to CC and payback time and is close to the optimal longevity derived from an optimization model. Saplings from 13 tropical tree species were grown under three levels of irradiance. Specific-CC was computed, as well as CC scaled to leaf area at the metamer level. Photosynthesis was recorded over the leaf life span. Payback time was derived from CC and a simple photosynthesis model. Specific-CC displayed only little interspecific variability and irradiance-elicited plasticity, in contrast to CC scaled to leaf area. Leaf life span ranged from 4 months to {\textgreater}26 months among species, and was longest in seedlings grown under lowest irradiance. It was always much longer than payback time, even under the lowest irradiance. Leaves were shed when their photosynthesis had reached very low values, in contrast to what was predicted by an optimality model. The species ranking for the different traits was stable across irradiance treatments. The two pioneer species always displayed the smallest CC, leaf life span, and payback time. All species displayed a similar large irradiance-elicited plasticity.},

abstract = {The overuse of rainforests in the last century and its consequences necessitate a rethinking of logging policies. To this end models have been developed to simulate rainforest dynamics and to allow optional management strategies to be evaluated. Parameterisation of presently existing models for a certain site needs a lot of work, thus the parameterisation effort is too high to apply the models to a wide range of rainforests. Hence, in this paper we introduce the simplified model FORREG using the knowledge we have gained from a more complex model, FORMIX3-Q. The FORREG model uses differential equations to determine the volume growth of three successional species groups. Parameterisation is simplified by a genetic algorithm, which determines the required internal model parameters from characteristics of the forest dynamics. The new model is employed to assess the sustainability of various logging policies in terms of yield and damage. Results for three forests are discussed: (1) the tropical lowland rain forest in the Deramakot Forest Reserve, (2) the Lambir National Park in Malaysia and (3) a subtropical forest in Paraguay. Our model reproduces both undisturbed forest dynamics and dynamics of logged forests simulated with FORMIX3-Q very well. However, the resultant volumes of yield and damage differ slightly from those gained by FORMIX3-Q if short logging cycles are simulated. Choosing longer logging cycles leads to a good correspondence of both models. For the Deramakot Forest Reserve different logging cycles are compared and discussed.},

abstract = {Successful growth of a tree is the result of combined effects of biotic and abiotic factors. It is important to understand how biotic and abiotic factors affect changes in forest structure and dynamics under environmental fluctuations. In this study, we explored the effects of initial size [diameter at breast height (DBH)], neighborhood competition, and site condition on tree growth, based on a 3-year monitoring of tree growth rate in a permanent plot (120 × 80 m) of montane Fagus engleriana–Cyclobalanopsis multiervis mixed forest on Mt. Shennongjia, China. We measured DBH increments every 6 months from October 2011 to October 2014 by field-made dendrometers and calculated the mean annual growth rate over the 3 years for each individual tree. We also measured and calculated twelve soil properties and five topographic variables for 384 grids of 5 × 5 m. We defined two distance-dependent neighborhood competition indices with and without considerations of phylogenetic relatedness between trees and tested for significant differences in growth rates among functional groups. On average, trees in this mixed montane forest grew 0.07 cm year−1 in DBH. Deciduous, canopy, and early-successional species grew faster than evergreen, small-statured, and late-successional species, respectively. Growth rates increased with initial DBH, but were not significantly related to neighborhood competition and site condition for overall trees. Phylogenetic relatedness between trees did not influence the neighborhood competition. Different factors were found to influence tree growth rates of different functional groups: Initial DBH was the dominant factor for all tree groups; neighborhood competition within 5 m radius decreased growth rates of evergreen trees; and site condition tended to be more related to growth rates of fast-growing trees (deciduous, canopy, pioneer, and early-successional species) than the slow-growing trees (evergreen, understory, and late-successional species).},

abstract = {The principles and characteristics of sixteen forest-soil-atmosphere models, describing the flows of water, carbon and nutrients in a forest ecosystem were compared. This comparison addresses technical aspects of model implementation and system discretisation, as well as the nature of the included processes. A large variety of integrated models exists, but only a few of them are 'well-balanced', describing all aspects of the forest ecosystem with a comparable level of detail. As a result, only a few models can be used to assess effects of air pollution and acid deposition on forest growth. There is considerable agreement with respect to the description of the water cycle and geochemical processes; differences result mainly from different levels of process aggregation. There is no general agreement on the description of the nutrient cycle. Models differ most with respect to nutrient uptake and nutrient (re)allocation in the plant. It is impossible to develop simple lumped models for regional, policy-oriented applications, without a well-based strategy for simplification. Therefore, simple models should always be backed up by more detailed mechanistic models, which can be tested against field observations. Only a few models are well-documented and available to others. The lack of concise and adequate model documentation hampers model exchange and may lead to unnecessary development of new models. Therefore, model documentation must be given high priority. ?? 1995.},

abstract = {Despite striking differences in climate, soils, and evolutionary history among diverse biomes ranging from tropical and temperate forests to alpine tundra and desert, we found similar interspecific relationships among leaf structure and function and plant growth in all biomes. Our results thus demonstrate convergent evolution and global generality in plant functioning, despite the enormous diversity of plant species and biomes. For 280 plant species from two global data sets, we found that potential carbon gain (photosynthesis) and carbon loss (respiration) increase in similar proportion with decreasing leaf life-span, increasing leaf nitrogen concentra-tion, and increasing leaf surface area-to-mass ratio. Produc-tivity of individual plants and of leaves in vegetation canopies also changes in constant proportion to leaf life-span and surface area-to-mass ratio. These global plant functional relationships have significant implications for global scale modeling of vegetation–atmosphere CO 2 exchange. Enormous interspecific variation in plant traits has been observed, with growth rate, photosynthesis, respiration, leaf life-span, leaf nitrogen, and specific leaf area (SLA) (a mea-sure of leaf surface area per unit mass) varying 10-to 100-fold among species (1–5). Such variation is thought to represent adaptations to the range of environmental conditions that occur in habitats as divergent as alpine tundra, desert, and tropical rain forest. However, if combinations of plant func-tional characteristics recur repeatedly in distantly related taxa across a broad geographic range, it would indicate that nature's selective forces constrain the collective traits that exist in any species (5, 6). Here, we test the hypothesis (5, 6) that variation in plant traits is highly constrained, with all plant species having traits that fall at some point on a universal tradeoff surface. To test this hypothesis, we quantified net photosyn-thesis, other leaf traits, and their interrelationships in the field for 111 species of terrestrial higher plants from six biomes that vary widely in climate (Fig. 1). Leaf trait data were collected for 111 tree, shrub, and herbaceous C 3 species (10–43 per region) in the following biomes: lowland tropical rain forest in Venezuela, subtropical coastal plain forest in South Carolina; montane cool temperate forest in North Carolina; desert͞ shrubland in New Mexico; cold temperate forest, bog, and prairie in Wisconsin; and alpine tundra͞subalpine forest in Colorado. These regions differ tremendously in climate, with mean annual temperature varying from Ϫ3 to 26°C, mean annual precipitation from 220 to 3500 mm, and elevation from 4 to 3500 m. Hence, the study areas span a broad range of vegetation types and almost the entire range of climates in which terrestrial plants grow (Fig. 1). Study species were chosen to span the range of leaf traits common in each biome (Table 1) based on a priori knowledge of the sites and their species. For young, mature leaves of each species, light-saturated net photosynthetic capacity (A max) and leaf diffusive conductance were measured in the field (7–9) under ambient CO 2 concentrations and SLA (projected leaf area per dry mass), dark respiration (at 25°C), and N concen-tration of those leaves were assessed, on both mass and area bases. Average leaf life-span (month ϭ 30.4 days) was assessed for each species in the field, from long term monitoring of numerous leaves and͞or phenological observation. Field data on leaf, plant, and ecosystem characteristics also were com-piled from the literature for species from several continents and an equally broad array of biomes. Log (base 10) transfor-mations of the data were required to normalize the data distribution, linearize the regression functions, and stabilize the error term variances. In addition to necessary statistical reasons, leaf trait relationships were quantified using power functions of the form log y ϭ a ϩ b log(x) because of their common application in biological scaling studies (5, 10, 11). Thus, the dependent variable changes as y ϰ x},

abstract = {Aim Modelling species distributions at the community level is required to make effective forecasts of global change impacts on diversity and ecosystem functioning. Community predictions may be achieved using macroecological properties of communities (macroecological models, MEM), or by stacking of individual species distribution models (stacked species distribution models, S-SDMs). To obtain more realistic predictions of species assemblages, the SESAM (spatially explicit species assemblage modelling) framework suggests applying successive filters to the initial species source pool, by combining different modelling approaches and rules. Here we provide a first test of this framework in mountain grassland communities. Location The western Swiss Alps. Methods Two implementations of the SESAM framework were tested: a ‘probability ranking' rule based on species richness predictions and rough probabilities from SDMs, and a ‘trait range' rule that uses the predicted upper and lower bound of community-level distribution of three different functional traits (vegetative height, specific leaf area, and seed mass) to constrain a pool of species from binary SDMs predictions. Results We showed that all independent constraints contributed to reduce species richness overprediction. Only the ‘probability ranking' rule allowed slight but significant improvements in the predictions of community composition. Main conclusions We tested various implementations of the SESAM framework by integrating macroecological constraints into S-SDM predictions, and report one that is able to improve compositional predictions. We discuss possible improvements, such as further understanding the causality and precision of environmental predictors, using other assembly rules and testing other types of ecological or functional constraints.},

abstract = {Background and Aims When ecologically important plant traits are correlated they may be said to constitute an ecological ‘strategy' dimension. Through identifying these dimensions and understanding their inter-relationships we gain insight into why particular trait combinations are favoured over others and into the implications of trait differences among species. Here we investigated relationships among several traits, and thus the strategy dimensions they represented, across 2134 woody species from seven Neotropical forests.
Methods Six traits were studied: specific leaf area (SLA), the average size of leaves, seed and fruit, typical maximum plant height, and wood density (WD). Trait relationships were quantified across species at each individual forest as well as across the dataset as a whole. ‘Phylogenetic' analyses were used to test for correlations among evolutionary trait-divergences and to ascertain whether interspecific relationships were biased by strong taxonomic patterning in the traits.
Key Results The interspecific and phylogenetic analyses yielded congruent results. Seed and fruit size were expected, and confirmed, to be tightly related. As expected, plant height was correlated with each of seed and fruit size, albeit weakly. Weak support was found for an expected positive relationship between leaf and fruit size. The prediction that SLA and WD would be negatively correlated was not supported. Otherwise the traits were predicted to be largely unrelated, being representatives of putatively independent strategy dimensions. This was indeed the case, although WD was consistently, negatively related to leaf size.
Conclusions The dimensions represented by SLA, seed/fruit size and leaf size were essentially independent and thus conveyed largely independent information about plant strategies. To a lesser extent the same was true for plant height and WD. Our tentative explanation for negative WD–leaf size relationships, now also known from other habitats, is that the traits are indirectly linked via plant hydraulics.},

abstract = {Forest growth models are useful tools for investigating the long-term impacts of logging. In this paper, the results of the rain forest growth model FORMIND were assessed by a multicriteria decision analysis. The main processes covered by FORMIND include tree growth, mortality, regeneration and competition. Tree growth is calculated based on a carbon balance approach. Trees compete for light and space; dying large trees fall down and create gaps in the forest. Sixty-four different logging scenarios for an initially undisturbed forest stand at Deramakot (Malaysia) were simulated. The scenarios differ regarding the logging cycle, logging method, cutting limit and logging intensity. We characterise the impacts with four criteria describing the yield, canopy opening and changes in species composition. Multicriteria decision analysis was used for the first time to evaluate the scenarios and identify the efficient ones. Our results plainly show that reduced-impact logging scenarios are more ‘efficient' than the others, since in these scenarios forest damage is minimised without significantly reducing yield. Nevertheless, there is a trade-off between yield and achieving a desired ecological state of logged forest; the ecological state of the logged forests can only be improved by reducing yields and enlarging the logging cycles. Our study also demonstrates that high cutting limits or low logging intensities cannot compensate for the high level of damage caused by conventional logging techniques.},

abstract = {Aim$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSuccessional and soil filtering processes are key drivers of the assembly of tropical tree communities, yet little is known about how they interact. Herein, we determine whether successional pathways depend on soil type, how the soil filtering effect varies during forest succession and whether succession is accompanied by changes in trait composition.$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$nLocation$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSouth-western Central African Republic.$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMethods$\backslash$n$\backslash$nWe used inventory data on 90 dominant tree species (72{\%} of the stems ≥ 30 cm d.b.h.) in 15,420 plots (each 0.5 ha) distributed over an 8300-km2 mosaic of primary and secondary forests on contrasting clay and sandy soils. We gathered data on six traits: dispersal mode, nitrogen fixation, deciduousness, leaf area, wood density and maximum diameter. After validation with historical information, we used a successional index based on pioneer proportion to assess variations in trait composition, and in $\alpha$- and $\beta$-diversity, in forest succession, and within and between soil types.$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$nResults$\backslash$n$\backslash$nTaxonomic and functional dissimilarities between clay and sandy soils decreased continuously during forest succession. Within soil types, early-successional communities had a low taxonomic but relatively high functional $\alpha$-diversity. At the landscape scale, $\beta$-diversity was higher among earlier successional stages, except in rich soils where taxonomic $\beta$-diversity was high throughout the succession. Mean values for all traits, except leaf area, showed marked variations during forest succession in both soil types.$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMain conclusions$\backslash$n$\backslash$nThe effect of soil type on community composition declines during succession, suggesting that the relative importance of neutral processes is higher in mature forests. Successional pathways were fairly similar in both soil types: disturbances reduced taxonomic diversity locally and enhanced $\beta$-diversity between sites, probably because the disturbances varied in type. We also demonstrated how easy-to-collect traits help improve predictions of ecological patterns and deepen our understanding of species assembly processes.},

@article{baraloto_using_2012-1,
abstract = {1. Niche theory proposes that species differences underlie both coexistence within communities and the differentiation in species composition among communities via limiting similarity and environmental filtering. However, it has been difficult to extend niche theory to species-rich communities because of the empirical challenge of quantifying niches for many species. This has motivated the development of functional and phylogeny-based approaches in community ecology, which represent two different means of approximating niche attributes. 2. Here, we assess the utility of plant functional traits and phylogenetic relationships in predicting community assembly processes using the largest trait and phylogenetic data base to date for any set of species-rich communities. 3. We measured 17 functional traits for all 4672 individuals of 668 tree species co-occurring in nine tropical rain forest plots in French Guiana. Trait variation was summarized into two ordination axes that reflect species niche overlap. 4. We also generated a dated molecular phylogenetic tree based on DNA sequencing of two plastid loci (rbcL and matK) comprising 97{\%} of the individuals and 91{\%} of the species in the plots. 5. We found that, on average, co-occurring species had greater functional and, to a lesser extent, phylogenetic similarity than expected by chance. 6. We also found that functional traits and their ordination loadings showed significant, albeit weak, phylogenetic signal, suggesting that phylogenetic distance provides pertinent information on niche overlap in tropical tree communities. 7. Synthesis. We provide the most comprehensive examination to date of the relative importance of environmental filtering and limiting similarity in structuring tropical tree communities. Our results confirm that environmental filtering is the overriding influence on community assembly in these species-rich systems.},

Progress is likely to be rapid if model developers identify the potential users of their models and the needs of those users. Users include operational forest managers, planners, bureaucrats, politicians, community and environmental groups, scientists, and academics. Extant models that could be used immediately or could be adapted for use by these groups are reviewed. Currently available process-based models can provide good estimates of growth and biomass productivity at various scales; combined with conventional models they can provide information of the type required by managers and planners. Climate-driven models can provide good estimates of potential plantation productivity, while detailed process models contribute to our understanding of the way systems function and are essential for future progress.

abstract = {Understanding, modeling, and predicting the impact of global change on ecosystem functioning across biogeographical gradients can benefit from enhanced capacity to represent biota as a continuous distribution of traits. However, this is a challenge for the field of biogeography historically grounded on the species concept. Here we focus on the newly emergent field of functional biogeography: the study of the geographic distribution of trait diversity across organizational levels. We show how functional biogeography bridges species-based biogeography and earth science to provide ideas and tools to help explain gradients in multifaceted diversity (including species, functional, and phylogenetic diversities), predict ecosystem functioning and services worldwide, and infuse regional and global conservation programs with a functional basis. Although much recent progress has been made possible because of the rising of multiple data streams, new developments in ecoinformatics, and new methodological advances, future directions should provide a theoretical and comprehensive framework for the scaling of biotic interactions across trophic levels and its ecological implications.},
